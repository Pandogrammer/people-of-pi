As someone who has been using Bitcoin since 2012, I'm not aware of any historical examples of paid marketing efforts amounting to long term BTC-denominated price appreciation of any altcoin. If we look at what Bitcoin and Ethereum did, none of their successes were borne out of paid marketing channels.

IYAM crypto marketers have only *one job*: to increase the price of DCR measured in BTC. *No other metric counts*.

Based on the lackluster price performance of DCR, it is abundantly clear the ROI of paying anyone to ""market"" Decred in any capacity has been negative. The numerous paid marketing proposals over the years of Decred's history have done absolutely nothing to raise Decred awareness. There are many reasons for this, which I have elaborated on in great detail on Reddit: https://old.reddit.com/u/atweiden

All crypto marketers paid by this treasury have completely and abjectly failed Decred stakeholders, over and over again. Individuals being paid to manage ""paid marketing results"" in low-impact regions like Latin America should be the *first* to receive the axe.",82bd0d6326d91addf12c81099e46c700fc4f967ce7b79c691f520f247bfa20167ed3a3c48944c71341a14eba174c4c2130415aa47086ed522a41af36aea5ab06,7fface550c654dc2b3a33ad3ed2faad8d08bd3082a4d07586ebde715af5ef945,1,b8bd4869b3040e43bd06f6ea876063e7996392502cc39728c220619011b0099495bfb5372a7ba80801975cc4812eb424f3d79b98ce3832b6db492e84f8be730d,1606870261,3,3.0,False,87635997-9d54-4059-b3d2-aa483c7c9077,atweiden,

That it will produce a narrative *so provocative* it will tangibly increase the delta between Decred's perceived progress and Bitcoin's perceived progress measured in BTC terms.

Cryptocurrency valuation is a battle of narratives. The most obvious symptom of narrative primacy is organic community activity. Conventional marketing of cryptocurrency has little to no impact on narrative primacy or organic community activity: there are no counterexamples. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, ""Paid Marketing Results"" and ""cryptocurrency"" don't belong in the same sentence.

*""Does it meme?""*

After looking at DCR/BTC price performance, this is the next question to be asked.

Is the narrative of Latino busy bees working on important sounding marketing things sufficient for creating a provocative narrative? Assuming the market doesn't perceive the delta of that narrative to be positive, it isn't going to positively impact DCR/BTC price, and therefore the value to this treasury *of it* is less than 0.

Seeing as the ""dcrlatam"" team has put forth no provocative ideas of their own — they just want to do more of the same which is *obviously worthless* — this is the only possible provocative narrative they could be contributing to: ""Latino busy bees"". Is that a speculative or *developing* provocative narrative? No. Therefore the value to this treasury is less than 0.

There is just no sugar coating it. They should be fired, as should every other paid marketer of Decred. Currencies are *belief systems*. There are more people on this planet who believe in ""flat earth"" than who believe in Decred. Who has come up with a narrative at least as strong as that? It isn't even clear if flat earth levels of memeification are sufficient to produce a positive delta against Bitcoin's narrative, which is fundamentally challenging the global economic system.",84bf6d0fbfb48b97daf82e7063883cbadc1c9cd6f5414ec9e705ff51d6951df848c4d44edd6e39ed12f8683948887f23e790ddaa20c09647c2aa01c7405ae20e,7fface550c654dc2b3a33ad3ed2faad8d08bd3082a4d07586ebde715af5ef945,10,94d92364030af4da8cecfa37dcf1150a9c26ace50b7214c70428b94b7207ebc4af73adf19ae6a3d23367e219c88091b6aa6efc361c2c1e42daa8aaee3cd3fc02,1606939952,0,1.0,False,87635997-9d54-4059-b3d2-aa483c7c9077,atweiden,1.0

I am pushing people to innovate and shake things up. I believe we need to expand and get increasingly creative in how we do things on the marketing front, I want to feel inspired by the proposed work and hear about how you intend to expand the pie.

I am not convinced that this is value for money as yet (and I request that you convince me why I am wrong in this opinion or consider tactics/strategies to amplify growth).

Regarding devs, please do not ask me to zoom in, it is your responsibility in this proposal to present such data, objectives and results for me (and others), especially the non spanish speaker stakeholder to assess.

You are not marketing to Latin America: you are marketing to Latin America *in the hopes* of *signaling* to the couple *thousand* anarchists and investors living in North America, Western Europe and East Asia who *matter* that Decred is worth investing in.

IYAM, it would take nothing short of a South American *Crypto Woodstock* for these people to be arsed enough to care even in the slightest about a ""paid marketing event"" of any sort. People are so jaded to this unprincipled, inorganic marketing bullshit by now, I doubt if even the biggest crypto conferences matter anymore at all — dick measuring contexts aside.

I'm truly sorry people were nice to you at any point in your cryptocurrency upbringing.

Please excuse me for thinking your decision to call out opportunity expansion for humans in ""developing nations"" was somehow not social justice themed. Clearly it is, though, if we're being objective about it.

It isn't what *I* would find useful, it's what those who were using Bitcoin c. 2009-2011 would find useful. This is the case because they have all the money.

I was lucky enough to meet several such individuals. They were leftist anarchists by and large, and were into things like fundamentally reshaping society for sustainability and individual empowerment. Almost all were programmers. All understood marketing. All were well-versed in economics and global politics.

> but surely there was stuff that was sponsored by someone or some entity for the sake of awareness

There really wasn't, though. There were attempts, sure — Bitpay tried sponsoring a major football event once. It didn't really add up to anything though, and much of the media exposure Bitcoin did get it got because existing journalists were infatuated with Bitcoin's provocative core narrative, which above all else Decred lacks right now.

I'm sorry, but cryptocurrencies trade based on narrative 100%. We need a provocative narrative to increase the perceived delta between DCR's progress and BTC's, and if you can't provide that service, then do what you want to to without charging the treasury, or face my wrath.

One of the issues I found with the [last proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/3c02b67) is that it was to big for Politeia readers, [first one ](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5af0ce1)was slightly shorter, that is why I cut this one in two, I'll add more references for stakeholders to access github to gauge the proposal. You're right, one of the big issues that I see is that all the work that is done in Decred in Spanish is hardly observed by stakeholders that don't speak Spanish. Having a [Github repository](https://github.com/DecredES/Monthly_reports) with all the reports was a first step, but I recon that reports are not sexy, however reporting has been a priority since the first proposal.   

Completely agree with you on being creative with marketing, by the way, this proposal doesn't not have the word marketing in it, how can we marketing a product that we cannot measure how is being sold? I recon that outreach and communications is more align with the work we do.  On this regard, I think the [first steps through out 2019 and early 2020](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5af0ce1) were to gain brand awareness from the professionals and leaders of the industry in Latam. An example of how this resulted is this acknowledgement of recent price action by [Anibal Garrido](https://twitter.com/anibalcripto/status/1334317634880479239), a well known and respected crypto trader in Venezuela. We met back in March when [I presented the project in Valencia, Venezuela](https://twitter.com/Decred_ES/status/1236079742643773440), you can see him in the front of the picture with a Bitcoin t-shirt. Since then [Anibal has invited us](https://twitter.com/anibalcripto/status/1278478260716933120) to talk about [governance](https://twitter.com/anibalcripto/status/1279191924835061761), you can spot he is wearing a blue Decred t-shirt that I gave him in Venezuela, later on [we invited him](https://twitter.com/Decred_ES/status/1313526622927171585) to talk about Venezuela in [#HablemosDecred](https://youtu.be/xxNFxZJuOwA)).

The next step in the big strategy for Decred in Spanish is to keep [building a platform of communications](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/3c02b67) through Decred_ES, which I arguably is only a few hundreds nearing a thousand people, however this is now recognised as an established brand in the cryptocurrency ecosystem in Spanish. I'd argue that other projects have gone the same route after us: [Algorand](https://twitter.com/Algorand_ES), [Avalanche](https://twitter.com/avalanche_esp), [Bisq](https://twitter.com/BisqEs), [Nervos](https://twitter.com/NervosNetworkES), setting the standard? 

I'll like to show you the [opinion of a dev](https://imgur.com/a/symKi18) that is participating in the [Decred Talent Land Blockchain Challenge](url) that portraits what we are aiming at Decred in Spanish: 

> ""This is my first hackathon, the experience was incredible, Decred in Spanish community has been helpful and attentive, you were amazing guys. The last hour I almost got a stroke, my video wasn't uploading to Youtube. So many hours of learning, this was a completely new world for me as a dev, thank you so much to everyone!!""

Can't go much into details because winners selection is this week but the ideas that are coming from this event are really good, furthermore, we are training new devs into the arts of Decred, several of them are interested in continue learning how to contribute to the project development. The Decred Talent Land Blockchain Challenge gave us [+6 hours of content](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHZZTXR_CIhJrZHnf3xgUrF6EdNsuG_Qa) for Youtube, +15,000 views into the [microsite](https://www.talentland.talent-republic.tv/challenge/blockchain-learning-challenge-decred/), 138 registrations and 7 final projects that are connecting to Decred's blockchain. 

Much of our work is to find ways to interact with the Spanish speaking cryptocurrency audience beyond price. We all love when PGU (price goes up) but no one like when PGD (price goes down). My main objetive is to build something that does not rely on PGU but in all the aspects that surround the technology that makes possible for PGU on the first place. The objective of Decred in Spanish is to keep building regardless of PGU or PGD, our content aims to tackle more issues surrounding the industry. Further more, as every other project or coin just want to sell their token to the retail market, having started Decred in Spanish not from the stance of ""buy DCR"" but from ""come and consume our wealth of knowledge"", many doors have open up over time because the space recognise that we sincerely want to share our tech and wealth of knowledge for everyone else to grow with us. 

You're right, even though the Github repo gives a lot of information there are still plenty of data, objectives and insights that could be there to give stakeholders more information to asses the work of Decred in Spanish. There are still plenty of things for reporting that could give better information for stakeholders, I've been working [on it with bee](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/pull/75) and even tho is not explicitly contemplated in the proposal included in it,[ reporting, reporting, reporting](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/tree/master/index). Still plenty to update and take it to the next level that is to link it to social media channels, telegram bots and the Decred in Spanish website (included in this proposal) to track engagement and give insights to stakeholders on what is working and what is not. The reduction of 10% in this proposal from previous translate in no paid sponsorships for the next 6 months, they were useless in comparison to what the Decred Challenge gave us in return. I care to maximise what every atom can bring to the table, to repeat what is working and cut what is not.

Adding more information to the Decred Talent Land Blockchain Challenge, adcade has now released the  6 final projects that are going to be evaluated over the next days, please visit [the following Github repository](https://github.com/DecredES/Challenge/blob/main/Final_Projects.md) to know more.

They've demonstrated a huge effort in trying to get the word out, unfortunately said content has not gotten the traction one would've hoped given the following, views and engagement numbers. However, I do understand the wider community's apprehensiveness on continued funding for these activities when it seems like the only useful marketing and outreach strategy is for the DCR price to go up, which is really outside of anyone's control.

That being said, and I have my bias having been born and raised and Venezuela myself, I think it would be a mistake to completely drop our efforts in the region. There is a huge opportunity in Latin America for Decred to have a meaningful impact throughout this upcoming market cycle, not quite as a store of value or medium of exchange, but as a decentralized autonomous organisation than can hire engineering talent from anywhere in the world, pushing the envelope by fostering the development of open source technology for the benefit of the wider ecosystem with no strings or rent-seeking attached. This isn't about being a charity or some SJW nonsense, necessity is the mother of invention, and I think efforts like the [Locha Mesh](https://locha.io/) are a great example of this.

The Decred stack has grown quite a lot over the past few years: decrediton, dcrtime, politea, mobile apps, lightning network, dcrdex, it truly is the Swiss army knife of crypto. IMHO the challenge is now to scale and gain developer and engineering mind-share, probably the scarcest resource in the space, to get people not just using Decred, but building on it.

Lightning Network may be a great platform to do this, and Decred's user on-boarding is considerably easier than Bitcoin's - the toughest part is to buy DCR.

On the contrary, sometimes people tell us that Decred is more democratic, we are careful to note that is not, is open and accesible but voting power comes from skin in the game, not from a democratic redistribution of wealth or anything like it. Critics like atweiden think that we are creating a narrative of distributing wealth and social justice, comparing the treasury to some sort of [socialist entity](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/jxum72/activities_report_5_decred_in_spanish_proposal_2/) giving away free money. The Treasury isn't giving free money, rewards people reputation and prior work. 

I do think that the nature of Decred allows for anyone to receive compensation for their work regardless of their location or monetary national situation. On this regard, we do talk about the power of Decred DAO in employing anyone from anywhere. And our team is a good probe of this, as you mention before, building teams is quite an endeavour and Decred in Spanish team now extends over three countries in Latam: Mexico, Colombia and Argentina (headhunting in Venezuela). On this regards I feel super proud of the team that I have build over the past two years, why? Because I build something bigger than myself, if I were to leave the project tomorrow, Decred in Spanish would continue working and creating content because is set as an organisation that can work on its own. I agree with you that being able to have a global workforce regardless of national constrains is powerful and revolutionary. 

issedjur asked below that of great value have you given to the project? The answer is a team of passionate people that understand Decred vision of the world and are professionally capable of working within the project for its perpetuation. Decred in Spanish is the result, as of today the teams has weekly calls every Monday since June, hundreds of messages for coordination of activities in four different Telegram channels. As with the image I send you before of the thread of emails behind the Decred Challenge, there is a ton of work that is not visible (and boring) but is the key to build what we have build. Be certain that by my self I couldn't have made a third of what we have done so far. Decred in Spanish is after all an international team in Mexico, Colombia and Argentina of cryptocurrency professionals building Decred ecosystem in Spanish.

I cannot promise NGU but I can plan for the next 6 months of Spanish content for people to pay attention when NGU. A few comments below you'll see a comment from bochinchero, when he joined in 2018 there was zero Spanish content, and this is something that I believe is overlook. atweiden questioned on Reddit if Decred in Spanish would have born organically without investing money on people, I think not. Treasury investing in people is what resulted in Decred in Spanish. 

The more the project invest in building the ecosystem the more engagement, curiosity and activity will happen in the community and the network. Just a few weeks ago we receive a couple of messages in Decred in Spanish Telegram channel from Spanish users that bought DCR with their pension fund, they were quite scared because at that time DCR was rosing 11 USD, I really hope they hodl but is hard to know. I don't know where they learned about Decred but they share they bought in the Decred in Spanish telegram channel, my conclusion is that there is a direct correlation between Decred regional investment and community activity. Investing in regional efforts is investing in the more broad global effort to increase brand awareness of Decred. 

Why Decred in China hasn't grow?",c535fda82e8c9b898c88ac8e6106487c9daf60de2e8c950ba0dccb4ea291042bf85c99c600ead2bfd5b6abd5d62a57f69a54365e89db00b0369b238dc4908500,f9da0bd73ab97e9e4b3097c71cfbac5273466eeac44520872fc65ae5c24274b0,30,dd2056bc6d30adbf889ad6c9f4ce239d858a15daae4a7ee8b26027d2a1907f7f62b9484fc8e2e5dffe2e61d042e5226f9f1baa854697111d60000c840c8c170e,1607101902,0,,False,0a6edc44-3a04-439e-af08-261854673cf9,3lian,

When I started volunteering in the project the goal was to increase awareness of Decred in the Spanish speaking world, no one said that the job was to pump the price of the coin against BTC. 

I guess that thousand people have investing a lot of money into brand awareness of BTC, right? Where is the organic growth you were mentioning in Reddit? 

They don't care, what would they care? BTC gives a damn about what we do but taht shouldn't stop this tiny altcoin community to freaking gran the bull by the horns and preach the word of Tacotime

Mate your approach if useless in the context of building the crypto ecosystem outside of your bubble. I am marketing to Latin America and Spain signalling to Spanish speaking audiences about the relevance of Decred in the gran scheme of crypto things. 

I agree that is important to market in North America, Europe and East Asia. When proposal?? Much talk little action.

Over the past two years I've build something bigger than myself for the project, this is Decred in Spanish. As of today, Decred in Spanish employs 7 cryptocurrency professionals from Mexico, Colombia and Argentina. Furthermore, Decred in Spanish team coordination is such that if tomorrow I would leave the project, Decred in Spanish would continue working and creating content. What we have done over the past 6 months would have been possible only as a team effort. 

Great question, I think I am but I am biased to answer, [a previous contractor thought I was the right fit](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5af0ce1cd325be6be39109c2750f34095c4e8feeea962ede058a1e4f4a61473e/comments/9) mentioning the following:

> Elian has demonstrated incredible initiative, witnessed by his list of events, translations, interviews, and most vitally, the team he has attracted and assembled to carry out his plan. He made great use of the Events and Marketing proposals, and I think he has earned the trust of the community to continue leading outreach in Mexico and Latin America. He has demonstrated all the traits required of an area lead: mastery of the crypto ecosystem and all things Decred, organizing local meetups, organizing larger scale events, generating content, spearheading partnerships, gaining media attention and doing interviews, recruiting new team members, managing various communications platforms, and sharing information across the Decred network. I believe he is a valuable contributor to the growth of Decred, and I hope he and his team are able to continue their good work. 

Yes, my general objective for growth is 80% in all the social media channels of Decred in Spanish. In aggregate, Decred in Spanish socia media channels grew by 142% if we consider the YouTube channel which had a 650% grow. If we discount YouTube, our growth was around  35% in the rest of social media channels. As you can see setting the bar at 80% is quite high, I think we will be able to achieve this goal over the next 6 months. 

I agree with you that when analysed in detail numbers are still low but please bare in mind that this grow has been organic and that we are not selling candies here, it is hard to sell a super scarce hyper volatile asset that has swing from 40USD, when I started collaborating in the project, to 40USD again a few days ago. We need to be careful of our narrative because we don't want people to buy Decred thinking they're going to be rich to find themselves in a situation where this may not be the case. This is why our approach is to stay away from price talk as much as possible, we are showing that Decred is much more than a hyper volatile asset, rather is also a global community of engineers and entrepreneurs building a common enterprise with cutting edge technology. Our approach is to build a wealth of knowledge that attracts people beyond the conversation of number goes up.

We have a plan and work flows necessary to deliver quality content, to push this content and to keep building bridges with the rest of the cryptocurrency industry.

Imagine Decred is an island that the more spends isolated from the rest of the world, the faster may become irrelevant. We have the best tech in the space, I truly believe this, but it is worthless if no one knows about it. This is our work, to get the word out. We could do it faster with advertisement but we align to Decred's ethos of not using corporate surveillance systems to target our potential users. This is why organic growth takes time, it is not easy and tends to chaos.

Thanks again for your comments and your critical approach to our proposal",11e6ddf1389210d134eb86c0997606c4abf6f5dae9ae6870ab15ba5d21d8f6bf0eb5f18f08737d0313c6830142415040503a6dfe62086f7056a963318032570f,f9da0bd73ab97e9e4b3097c71cfbac5273466eeac44520872fc65ae5c24274b0,32,5e0e24637147dac60cbed018c0ea669028e84f5605adc659ff49bd7342774fd79a716ab5932fe11413bb2e7dee0b65b43dfb652ad1de6ca7b07ab20f7f48340e,1607106540,0,,False,0a6edc44-3a04-439e-af08-261854673cf9,3lian,

When I signed for Decred as a volunteer and later as a contractor no one told me I had to pump the price with my work, on the contrary, as we are not selling candies here but a hyper speculative asset,  I was told to stay away from price, bare in main that when I enter the project DCR was $40. So under your logic would seem that I (we?) have caused the price to tank from $40 to $10. Don't know what to say here.

I see you mention you want 80% growth to your audience but you fail to show what your belief of the current audience size is, or past performance which gives us reason to doubt your ability of doing this.

I fail to see deliverables or signs of value for the project beyond making you and a few other Spanish speaking people talk about Decred for work, without a plan.

It might feel crude, but I think it's important to take a hard critical look at what value one presents to the project, or atleast be clear in outlining what value one has delivered so far.

I'm caught between having to babysit them through *too many* steps before they understand the project and start contributing, which shows they lack autonomy and strong interest. But I'm also noting that once I help a dev understand a bit, they become much more interested in the project and start to see how they can contribute.

I'm currently planning on continue to create video content for devs in Spanish and think other *hands on* ways, like the hackathon, to reach out to new people. Maybe create some ongoing challenges that makes them stick around once the major events end. Also, while this Hackathon was organized/hosted with a third-party company that charged us, I strongly believe we have developed the skills needed to make the next ones on our own.

At first I bought into the idea that devs do not need Spanish content, but since started working during the previous proposal to actively attract more devs in LATAM I realized there is *some* need for Spanish technical content. While most devs may know at least a bit of English, the complexity of cryptocurrencies present somewhat of a challenge to most of them (mostly young people who are considering contributing to crypto).
Since day one we had a plan: create some basic video content and a dedicated Telegram group where LATAM devs can gather and know each other. This was to prepare this new dev community for working on projects that contribute to Decred. The ongoing hackathon is the last step. As Elian said, 7 teams are presenting projects. While it took 6 months, I think it paid off and achieved the goals we had regarding new dev talent/interest.
For this 3rd proposal the idea is to double our efforts in that direction: organize a second hackathon and create some similar event for designers.
Seeing how the hackathon is working out, I would like to continue working in this direction.

1. I would like to know who we expect to be the artists that will be producing the works and who we expect the buyers to be in this instance? 

2.  Socialist Decred would fund the arts and go broke in the process. Capitalist Decred (my position) expects any venture it funds to produce greater value for the treasury than it outputs. My question is, why should Capitalist Decred fund more than one or two artworks at most? Why can't the income from the first two artworks sold, which could be bootstrapped by the the Treasury, not be deployed to paying for the remaining artwork? If my calculations are correct, spending $900 on production with expected return of $3000 should mean the whyDecred community fund can finance all future artwork off 1or 2 and remain in profit after a piece is sold. Thus I would not support any more than one or two at most being funded by Capitalist Decred with my preference for one followed by entrepreneurial spirit.

At this point, we already have too many offshoot decred websites that cater to various marketing and educational stuff.

For the price paid for each art which is rather exorbitant imo, i would rather pay the same amount to hire an army of paid DCR shillers and take the marketing actively to every corner of the interwebs. Not that i'm saying paying shillers is good, but for the sake of comparison, i'm quite sure the latter will yield better a result than just having a bunch of arts sitting in a website waiting for visitors who may or may not even know it exists.

* Imagine pausing and freezing a frame from a movie. It might look strange, out of context. But it's not, you're simply not looking at the full, completed picture.
* I've been analyzing what images Decredizens post on Twitter. They are different in nature from the core arts* of our site. The images people post on Twitter are made to stand alone by themselves, but  WhyDecred's core arts are made to stand together and tell a story. Once the site is complete, the pieces will create a coherent story in a context. Currently the site and arts are not complete.
* We will add a simple meme section with wall-worthy art, which will appeal to Decredizens in a quick glance. I think you will like these pieces. These will be the type of art you can relate to as individual pieces. 
* We are building a new, interesting rabbit hole for people to journey in. It is a new context, a new lens into Decred and fiat currency.
* It's a good sign you comment this, it means we are truly doing something new.
* Simpler art pieces are definitely coming.
* All arts are different, have different styles and are from different artists. Not all will be as complex as the treasury one. That piece is deep and rich, like our treasury.
* Some people appreciate the deepness of the pieces and all the meaning behind them.
* The Corrupt Bailouts and Handouts one is much simpler, for example.

I would also like to extend an invitation for us to have the humility to see that if we do not understand why the top art pieces of the world like the Mona Lisa you mention are so expensive and valuable, then maybe we have something new to learn and understand. Cheers man and thanks for the feedback.

* A core art is defined as the art pieces in List 1 and 2. Core art come in lists, they are made to tell a story across multiple images. Meme art is defined as art that is not part of a list and is designed to stand with relevancy by itself.",288eefc4d7840007068a10814af2aaff767f9a1cd0e981c0ae720ae5cf3615d8fe6f935d108dd50c64d833f82ec32d983c10a760890f32011e2b520f33700d00,5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f,15,681272f71bed9a781ae97a9bc6fb1aa444eb5b692cd2ca8bf263b54b5691d63d9072a3c84d03b155bf15b5de755931ecbfbc40b5afc051f5c52078a77c643a05,1605563093,1,2.0,False,5f05329d-fdea-406c-b68e-62210e29785b,paris_smithson,1.0

The [constitution](https://docs.decred.org/governance/decred-constitution/) makes a point that the project is about supporting open source software, and I think it's good to embrace open source wherever possible. For the website, you can make the code open source, and better still if it's a static site with an open source code repository it is easy for someone else to reproduce the site if your server goes down for any reason. To put it another way, when the code is open source and re-deployable, the project has a more robust asset that we can be confident will be available into the future. Without this kind of licensing and provision Decred has only whatever happens to be at the whydecred.com domain, which as the owner you retain full control over. I learned to use Hugo to make my own treasury-funded [sites](https://github.com/block-commons/) open source, with a license that allows them to be re-used.

For the artwork it might be more complicated, as you plan to sell prints and also the originals at some stage. I guess you could still release it under a license that allows for non-commercial use by others, so that the site could be re-hosted but not the shop. There is also a question about whether you or the artist would have ownership of the artwork. 

With the current scale of the proposal (16 pieces, $6,800 funding) it would be good to get some assurances on the licensing before moving forward.",ad4cd236212d5d058788ba59673f8375dad52ebb0d90a609a0011e3c113a5249e4eb0360038a5a2629f04d1b822494f4f426f57a916e21ecd2813a3a800fd303,cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e,19,31f0102cf8b51c62dac149c8ee14b3dcdcce43c23dc793d62ba32d51385124e30f2cbd1590eaa42a1bbbb358643090cb8d0837fb81fbef1bc5821978b7beb805,1605643821,2,2.0,False,350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c,richard-red,

**1.1** The artists are chosen from all around the world, we will later create a page with their names, photos and portfolio URL's.

**1.2** The buyers will be art collectors and Decred fans who wish to decorate their home/office with awesome, unique art. Art that many people will buy, but few will have the status and honor of owning the original piece. People routinely spend k's of dollars on art. The [most expensive art pieces in the world](https://www.businessinsider.com/most-expensive-paintings-ever-sold-including-157-million-nude-modigliani-2018-5?r=MX&IR=T) sell for hundreds of millions of dollars. [Closer to our range, you see them sell for 3k, 5k, 10k, 15k](https://shop.eden-gallery.com/en/art/collections/artworks). **As you can see in these links there is a market for these things.** [The art market is worth 64 billion per year](https://www.google.com/search?q=art+market+worth). The top art in the world are investments that appreciate over time. They are collectors items. 

**2.1** Can the Treasury go broke if this proposal is 0.15% of the Treasury at current prices? I feel very confident we will make the Decred price go up by **much more** than this amount. Visualize the site is complete, all arts and writing is done. Can you see the power it will have to change people's minds? It is very capitalist in terms of the return on investment. Plus, we are the first Decred marketing initiative to bring funds back from marketing efforts. How can this financially be a losing proposition?

**2.2** Great question! Currently one art is digital (the bailouts one) and one is a physical watercolor (the treasury one). Not all pieces will be physical, so this funding method you mention is limited. Why? Digital art enables us to edit and perfect the piece in a way that physical makes it impossible. So digital can be higher quality through continuous refinement and editing. Making less of the arts avaiable as physical originals will also help them get sold, as there are less available.

**2.3** Expensive art pieces take months to sell. Let's say it takes each original 3-6 months to sell, and we have 16. Marketing can start after all 16 pieces are complete. Do you want to start marketing of this initiative in >48 months, in >4 years? Or do you want to start marketing of this initiative in less than 5 months if this proposal passes? I'm sure we can agree sooner is better :)

**2.4** You are clearly an intelligent person who is strong with numbers. But the world is not all numbers, some people run on emotions and the more artistic side of life. Should we not make an effort to reach those people too? I see us as a team, our numbers people speak to other numbers oriented people, let our art people speak to artistically sensitive people, who are a new audience for us. Let us reach new audiences! I think this site will be very powerful in attracting new people to Decred. People who think and feel differently than a programmer. That is why Steve Jobs was so successful. He did not work as a programmer, we worked as a marketer and an artist. He said, [""real artists ship""](https://www.creativethinkinghub.com/steve-jobs-was-right-real-artists-ship/). He [signed the first Macs like pieces of art with his team](https://www.cultofmac.com/122408/signed-by-steve-jobs-co-signatures-inside-the-original-macintosh-case/). He saw technology as art, and millions resonated with this view.

**3.1** I wrote a bit about this in ""The WhyDecred.com Strategy in a Nutshell"", here is a recap, **plus a few new points**:

* You will bring eyes. All our community will bring eyes, by mentioning, posting and tweeting links to our site, using it as support and a place to welcome and convert new users.
* Rank via SEO. I can do this, look at my Flippa profile. When people search things related to money and fiat, we will appear in the search results. This constantly brings eyes, every month.
* Make such a high quality exposé of the true nature of fiat currencies, that we will attract links from all parts of the internet. Links also get eyes. Like Mises.org, people will link to us from all over.
* After the site is translated the eyes brought from search and from links will multiply.
* Via ads, including display, Twitter, Facebook, search and more. Even Reddit ads. This will be part of the monthly marketing budget, $2,400 in this case for the first test month.
* Make ads cheaper and higher converting with captivating art. This can make them 10x cheaper and more effective. This brings a multiple of more eyes.
* Hiring full time Twitter tweeters who will tweet and engage NEW PEOPLE 8 hours, 22 days a month. We will hire 2 full time people in the first month of our marketing test, included in this proposal. They will always tweet at someone new. This will brings new eyes.
* We will use our completed site as leverage to get into podcasts, interviews, etc. This will bring ears and eyes and new people. Podcasts need new guests constantly. We plan to target podcasts of all kinds unrelated to crypto, and some even unrelated to finance. Think outside the crypto/Decred box to get eyes outside the crypto/Decred box.
* We can target influencers and convert them into Decred. We will mount Twitter ads on top of tweets targeted at influencers, to gather a large amount of likes and retweets, and get their attention on our tweet and on our site. Once an inlcuencer is converted, he/she will help convert their entire audience. This brings new eyes.
* Our site will be ideally made to convert a large portion of the population, combining data and art in a way that is appealing to both hemispheres of the brain, not just one hemisphere. This makes the site convert more of the eyes that land on it.
* Once the site is complete, and after we provide measurable success, we can spend a fixed marketing sum per month to continually grow our community and pool of investors. This will monthly and continually bring new eyes.
* All of these points have ripple effects. A friend will invite their friend, and will use our site will fully convert them. 
* Our site will be like ammunition we can all use when we engage new people.

**With your support, this site can become a great converter of public opinion. The site will be similar to [Luthers 95 Theses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-five_Theses) in which he caused a tidal wave of change of opinion in the masses. This is what I envision for this site and the marketing efforts we place on top of it. I hope you support us in making this a reality! **

Anyone can read the website and see the art for free. It's more like a free-to-enter Decred museum where you learn about Decred and fiat currency, and you can optionally buy products. If you do make a purchase, we keep at most half the profit in order to keep running the store, and at most 33% when we sell an original art piece. Decred will always have the same amount of profit as us, and this will be spent according to the wishes of the community.

The whole take on mashing together fine art / art investment sector with commercial illustration work for marketing is super off-putting. If you make a case of reliably selling originals commissioned by an artist at a 70% margin (ie. – ie. 900 / 3000 $) of the production cost and whatever you sell the merch for, then you could already fund the project. 

As the project relies on illustration work, the starting point absolutely needs to be presenting the portfolios of the actual illustrators/artists involved, as well as whoever does the art direction. This is the most common and efficient way to assess ones ability and track record. Otherwise pig in the bag situation. 

Listing a bulk of work “for free” while the showcased demo site is nothing attractive and looks like it's been thrown together over an evening. This does not create any confidence on rest of the ""free"" items being of quality.

I personally get zero impression from the showcased pieces. Pi one looks on a quick glance like little mermaid fanart, and has little relevance to marketing DCR or crypto in general. The symbolism and metaphors don't make much sense for explaining these matters well. From a purely technical standpoint, using the hand-drawn artwork as such for basis on a wide range of collateral as described is not really optimal.

In terms of pricing, 900 USD can be very reasonable if we talk about well-established illustrators and properly defined use rights. Typically these are not set for unlimited follow-up commercialization. Pricing for fine art and the investment art sector is a whole other ballgame to begin with. Based off the showcased work and proposed plans, I find it unlikely that the marketing efforts with these pieces would bring anywhere as much results as described.",25ebcf040c7f9c96b70f2e94bd76247023da9c7051118e0fe768a56d749edccf443cbc567bfb8b4f30b5f1b5de0f434bf169704832035045d690bd1156ab3f0c,3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859,23,f9a3dbd18ddc721098999f946da9a5074aab16b1278f928d20f18c63ec13cd7f1757726ec0ff391410e9fbc4adbf2a8333e032f617493b4b182c1e393b598c07,1605655305,1,2.0,False,ba96e181-abff-4c1a-b2be-9bb916ea4083,linnutee,1.0

Leaving aside debate as to overall concept which has merit and the hosting and license detail and the debates over whether or not the treasury should fund art, the central issue here is a simple one. The quality of the art is poor.

I agree with  [Atwieden's](https://proposals.decred.org/user/87635997-9d54-4059-b3d2-aa483c7c9077) point, if you're going to do this and have any chance of making any sort of impact outside of the existing community you need to be able to land the art as real cultural moments.

Right now the benchmarks are pretty high - [this ](https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/1 )is not far off the standard of the sort of stuff I'd expect to see. 

Beeple is well known in digital art circles and has a [big following on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/beeple_crap/) and therefore if you commission someone like him, you actually reach out of the bubble.

There are other ways to go about this - curating younger up and coming artists who would have some pre-existing audiences but who would be happy to have a smaller commission. This could be mediated through someone like [MoCDA](https://www.instagram.com/beeple_crap/) who I know.

You have identified some potential topical areas, but the issue you'll find, is that if you want to get really great visual artists  then you should let them intepret Decred's proposition through their own lens, because ultimate that is exactly what you're paying for... artistic interpretation, else you may as well just use a bunch of cheap graphic designers and call it a brief.

It looks like you've spent a fair amount of time, but the fundamental issue is not really the  basic concept, but the quality. 

Do you have a strategy for onboarding a higher quality of artist?

> We want honest money and honest governance to succeed

This is the best motivation I can imagine for doing anything in Decred/crypto/finance.

I like the idea to use art to engage more parts of our brain. Ideally, not only brain. Also, just imagine what kinds of people we can attract/onboard through art.

> Target our marketing at people of the world with moral values.

This is the best, or even the only way to go IMO.

When I look back at our first attempt to write up [messaging](https://github.com/decredcommunity/outreach/blob/release/foundational-messaging.md), it feels like focusing on ""technical"", ""investors"" or ""mainstream"" audience is missing the point. Same for ""institutional"" and ""traders/speculators"". I don't know how to say it, but all these definitions are too ""dry"" in a way. They miss something important and may fail to work because of some intangible property of Decred.

There are people with moral values out there and they are our audience, however ""naive"" this may sound. They can share any of the categories listed above, but ""moral values"" should be the tuning to use.

If I were to compress ""Why Decred?"" it would be: ""In Decred my vote has power"" or ""Decred puts me close to consequences of my actions, good or bad"". ""Honest money and honest governance"" is pretty decent too. This doesn't sound sellable or exciting for anyone looking to get rich quick and/or avoid responsibility and have things decided for them. But it might be the core feature we can and should ""sell"", regardless of how many people buy it.

There are many movements for Austrian school/autonomy/sovereignty/privacy/etc with whom we are highly [aligned](https://xaur.github.io/writings/posts/20191127-marketing-strategies.html#reach-people-to-whom-it-really-matters) but are not connected while we dwell in our bubble. I guess we simply don't have enough ambassadors who could introduce Decred to these groups. For example, imagine if [these people](https://mises.org/about-mises/what-is-the-mises-Institute) would suddenly learn that something they have been theorizing is actively being built (and is already functioning for a small group of pioneers).

I am hopeful that the world is changing for the better and ""demand"" for moral values will increase significantly.

> Target high follower count individuals who might appreciate Decred and our stand on honest money

This is the best way to get any visibility I am aware of. I think it will get easier to detect these people by their position (and actions!) on the problems the world is facing today, i.e. we want those who don't buy lies and propaganda, stay reasonable and consistent.

Latest version 4 is a generous offer. Absorbing proposal's expenses is not a requirement to win a vote, but it will be appreciated by the stakeolders and everyone who has put many personal hours into Decred.

1\. Is there anything special about number _24_ for each list of problems/solutions?

2\. Do you plan to sell merch from the store? [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/jkmhbv/whydecredcom_proposal_open_talk/) was more explicit about it (""We will make an online store that pairs the art with clothing, posters, ..."") than this proposal.

3\. Will the store support DCR as a payment method (with a nice discount to incentivize use)?

> Make our sales transparent, with public item and timestamp reporting, so that anyone can audit us by making a purchase.

4\. Couldn't understand this. Is making a purchase required to audit?

> When an original art piece is sold, we agreed with the artists to give them a third of the sale, a third for us and a third for the WhyDecred project fund.

5\. Would it be feasible to give more % to the artist?

> Showcase our team of 16+ artists, 12+ translators

6\. Do you mean you have so many people for this proposal, or do you refer to Decred's existing artists and translators?

7\. More generally, introducing the team would help. That is, define who is ""we"" used throughout the proposal.

8\. Do you have experience in building up traffic for new websites, leading art projects, etc?

9\. [Flippa link](https://flippa.com/users/992972) requires login. Is there any other public link to check?

10\. Is there any concern with mixing an educational resource with a store? I assume you will separate these areas somehow. How about isolating the store at `store.withdecred.com` or `shop.withdecred.com` subdomain?

11\. What underlying servies do you plan to use for the store to not build all infrastructure from scratch (shipping/printing/etc)? Is it Printful and Printify that you mentioned? Can you please expand a bit how it works?",ff592dcaf3932bb5446101b3f5a68dcd0c0ddd76ffeadb123a192fa1c7e707540a0cba6033ac583b070cbc7a3be206882c302c417ea2e13cb5550e99d16b7006,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,35,36a6d3d5fee6b47c8bc203eb69a0344659fc6d1397d161b40559e1ec7acc9fa0e1cf1c00bc4780b6e30a82dbc134792eceec41a6a6d8c4982e46a75216ea9b00,1605757353,2,2.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

> Measure site traffic

1\. I recommend not injecting any third party tracking into whydecred.com and follow the approach taken by [withdecred.org](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2bf72e6) (self-hosted privacy-preserving analytics).

> This investment is guaranteed to increase the Decred price and amount of users by more than 0.056%.

2\. I recommend to have no expectations and to not hype up anyone's expectations regarding your impact on the price of DCR. You may do everything right and it will still drop because turning an entire market is too big of a task for one small group. The idea is worth pursuing regardless of whether this project increases the value of DCR by 0.056% :) To be honest, I would remove all talk about % of the Treasury.

> Cannot be Confiscated

3\. It is still possible to confiscate via device hacking or extortion. I would say ""much harder to confiscate compared to physical cash, digital fiat and gold"".

4\. Our community members produced tons of quality content and built a few websites over the years. Getting real views and traffic on content remains our biggest marketing challenge. I recommend to not rely on ""others will share my content"" as the main strategy since it did not bring huge results. I hope you have that magic many of us do not.

5\. Please be aware that Treasury payments are done in DCR and may deviate from the USD amount billed. This happens to be most inconvenient for compensating external expenses denominated in USD and all of the volatility risk falls on the contractor.",373b00f4d4d0a7623ab72c156f84edf2d05f9454ff8ff45487e96d51aa7a34982d5d197246aa73efe3ec756d6da44fb8e72db16597693d5e3478eee281259306,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,36,f9a19ee814c8c5adc4ccb5ed44b37637dc739c97ec2176ada06aa84511316cc797caa9936e741eaba583f70be5c86a3a2e4829363bf76bc23c670931daae2a03,1605757869,2,2.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

> The point of paying for any new marketing initiative is to keep trying until we find what works.

Keyword: ""new"". At best, the proposer is rehashing a narrative from 2009 that went stale a good 6 years ago. The rest of it is just him gas lighting people into believing the lie that this Little Mermaid ripoff artwork designed by clear amateurs is *so good* people will *hang it on their wall*.

Here it is: fire everyone who has ever been paid for marketing Decred in any capacity. Their efforts have culminated in the price of DCR tanking to nearly all-time bitcoin lows, which is the only metric that matters in this industry. I'd even amend the constitution to ban all future treasury spends relating to marketing. Marketing is the Home Ec of the business world.

People are mostly not sensitive to processes that run slowly enough, and this is how we got into our current state of money. To wake them up the message must be very clear, backed by evidence that is simple to understand and recognize in real life.

A sub-project of WhyDecred could be to compile historical evidence showing how fiat money tends to collapse sooner or later. I didn't study this in depth but the few instances I [looked into](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hjsgg1/the_federal_reserve_a_blatantly_rigged_game/) indicate that the power to create money has been abused for [centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome#Crisis_of_the_Third_Century). One big list/subsite could help make it obvious that ""Nope, we have tried it so many times and it always fails"". If there have been any instances of non-inflationary/deflationary systems we need to learn about them too. If there have been none or too few (compared to collapsed inflationary currencies), it poses an ugly question to ""economists"" preaching that price inflation is healthy, ""why do you keep pushing a system we know does not work and not suggesting to try something new instead?"".

Art pieces could also work nicely here, e.g. embed existing historical art depicting money abuse, or even draw some ""retroactive"" art pieces for that historical events.

That [rocket](https://twitter.com/ParisSmithson/status/1323071545867120641) pic looks cheaper than the other one, but it is a good metaphor. The rocket ejects fiat to drive those piloting it to success at the cost of everybody else who gets left behind with tons of useless paper. Might be worth developing this concept into a full piece?

How about making a high quality video with art pieces as slides with a voice over reading text about money/crypto/Decred?

How about augmenting the art pieces with some puzzles posted at [winatoms](https://twitter.com/winatoms)? The puzzles could ask non-trivial questions on each of the discussed topics and the winner would get a bit of DCR (while using smart contracts behind the scenes). It might even be possible to embed winatoms' text fields to remove cross-site barrier. Note that the site is not finished.

Consider posting a bunch of designs on [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/). I heard they have good service.

Regarding the art pieces, discussion is still open to see what is decided on the commercial aspect of the license.

These are excellent questions. I'm very open to discussing what is best, and I will take an official stance in a few days after all of us interested share our ideas here. Here are my initial thoughts:

* What would you recommend?
* What do the others reading this recommend?
* Commercial rights will probably need to be exclusive to WhyDecred.com, otherwise they might be sold on other sites in a way that diminishes our return on investment, since product profits will be shared to grow the project/Decred.
* But maybe we could allow the art to be sold everywhere, but with the condition that the price is not below our own, similar to how Amazon handles this. This commercial openness might bring even more awareness to Decred. We can require all stores to link back to us in order to use our art commercially. These links can in turn help us with SEO and help us rank better, increase our domain authority, and get more traffic from related google searches, especially searches related to fiat money.
* Everyone should be able to use the art anywhere, on any site, with the condition they do not remove the WhyDecred.com watermark. They might not need to link to us to use the arts in a non-commercial way, but it is appreciated. This is because tweets for example are too small to require a link. But maybe they can use a thread and link this way? Maybe we should also require links for non-commercial purposes?
* We can use reverse image search and track where our images are used in the internet, then request links back to us, in a master-level SEO strategy. We can be kind about this request and not force it, just kindly request as per our license. If someone ignores our request I would recommend not taking any further action.
* The Decred blockchain needs to be open source in order to be trusted and to allow collaboration. Our art store will use APIs to Printful and Printify and be heavily automated. I'm not sure there is much benefit of open sourcing it, maybe all we will accomplish is have competitor blockchains copycat our strategy and undermine our marketing efforts. Maybe code can be openly shared with trusted people like Jake Yocom-Piatt and others deep in our team, but in a way that it is not used by our competitors. I would like to share the code with our community but I don't want our strategy and site cloned, so that we maintain this site as a unique competitive edge of Decred.

I'd love to see everyone's comments on this. Great questions bee.

2. Yes, any merch from Printful and Prntify that makes sense. Why these providers? Because sales, production and shipping can be automated with them and the store hosted on our own site.
3. I would love to do this, however Printful and Pritify require payment in USD for the base cost of the merch, so this might not be so easy to do. However we can definately accept DCR for the original art pieces and for any blockchain tokenized art originals. We can also accept DCR for any ebook we sell, in the case we don't give it away for free, which we might.
4. Yes and no. I plan to release a table with all timestamped purchases, so this can be checked by anyone but this is a weak method of verifying. But if you make a purchase you will be able to verify how your transaction is recorded into this table, and this is a way to audit us. All sales will appear here. If we accept DCR to a specific address for some of the payments then this can be another way to audit us. I'm not sure how else we can be transparent about the store sales, but I would accept any method that is simple enough to implement.
5. Yes. I am thinking of opening up each writing area/topic to any artist, and anyone can maybe submit art. If it is decent we can list it on the site, and maybe anyone can sell their original art pieces in a way that we do not pay for them upfront, only get a commission on a sale, say 30% cut, 70% for the artist. I believe this rate is standard for most art galleries. 
6. Since every piece will be ideally made by a different artist, I refer to all the 16 artists that will be chosen. I have not contacted the rest of the artists yet.  I also refer to the translators that will be chosen. 
7. Us is me and the artists and translators and marketers/social media advocates that will be assembled if the proposal passes, and generally anyone you comes on board as we move along. Currently I have nobody else to introduce but myself. I prefer to invite others once this proposal passes. I prefer certain invitations than maybe invitations regarding who I invite to work with me.
8. Yes, I have experience building up traffic websites via SEO and link building. You can verify this on Flippa. I was able to build a 150k visits per month site with 1 week effort, and I can prove this with verifiable AdSense revenue and Google Analytics.
9. Thanks for letting me know! Here is a link of what my profile looks like behind a login https://photos.app.goo.gl/1ZrWdpGkGgbW9aMa6 .
10. No concerns here. We might separate the store, after I take a deep dive into the Shopify documentation and get my feet wet I'll decide.
11. I plan to leverage Shopify since they have easy tools to connect to Printful and Printify. Basically a user comes to WhyDecred.com and makes a purchase. Our Shopify store bills their card and later pays us minus their small fee. An API call from Shopify creates the order at either Printful or Printify (P/P). P/P then charges my credit card for the base cost of the merch, and then proceeds to manufacture what the customer ordered and ship it to him/her, on demand. P/P also have a service in which they warehouse products for us and ship them for us, so we can expand to other things later if we decide to.

Let me know if you have more questions bee, I'm happy to answer them all.",83033c052a70f2924b83ba2c8f3a8bbfc0e2d466bc0cbfc13ccff9277eb11cd658e0ade39908d6c8c13622afcb8e4b2b77293d8b338e1f3dea5450bfe7da4d08,5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f,44,624ef29d2cdf7074cda286b7c6716f4555fa07337eecfa1f66c20e83e134662dc30041215f160382851c0d929f629b924f17b917555e09c96a9049d36f6a1f03,1605830727,1,2.0,False,5f05329d-fdea-406c-b68e-62210e29785b,paris_smithson,1.0

* As you can see by bee's reply, (who is a Decred contractor by the way), art is very subjective. Many people loved the 2 pieces we did, others didn't. That's why we decided on artistic and creative diversity. I'm sure you will later find something you will truly like and I would bet that given enough art pieces, there will be something you would be proud to hang on your wall.
* Capturing art as a cultural moment is a great idea. Keep in mind not all art pieces can do this though. But definitely a great idea echoed by bee as well.
* The artist you propose has an impressive IG following. But consider he recently auctioned a piece covering the election for over $65k usd. How much would it cost us to hire someone like this? Just for a single post on his IG? Keep in mind that artists with high social counts price their art much higher, and it is not necessarily better art. The social count of the artists we hire is only one of our marketing strategies, not the only one nor the most important. There are many ways we can bring eyes to the site and I mentioned several of them.
* We could definately leverage any contacts you have over at MoCDA, thank you. I also support hiring up and coming artists. That way we can explore our other marketing methods/tactics. 
* I agree we should let the artist interpret the piece somewhat. The mermaid idea was not mine, for example, it was the artists. I think women will love this piece, who by the way are alarmingly underrepresented in Decred. 
* I have spent much more time on this than probably anyone is imagining. I can see that you must have entrepreneurial experience yourself to have seen this. 
* Think about the women who will love the ocean scene. Do we have many women here on Politeia? I don't know of even one.
* Sure, there are many ways to onboard an artist. We can pay them, we can let them sell their original piece on our store, we can inspire them from a moral standpoint, as a mission worth fighting for. We can offer them exposure and recognition, the more impressive artists we can work with, the more others will want to join our elite group. As Decred grows I predict artists will even work for free, just because they believe in this and are passionate about it. We can also attract them by helping them tokenize their digital originals and teach them about this. This last idea is new. There are more ways that will probably come to me as we move along. It is the nature of the creative process.
* The MetaDAO concept looks interesting, can you message me on Twitter so you can explain this to me further?

Impressive marketing proposal! I echo that I love the doer mentality/initiative and think this is another great grassroots idea and proposal. Additionally, I think whyDecred.com looks great so far. 

Thoughts/Comments:

1. I think I would feel a lot more comfortable with the Treasury funding a tester month or two of marketing + a few pieces of art (2-4 rather than 16 pieces @ $900 a piece). My thought is that we can gauge art interest/quality with the few pieces and then revisit adding more pieces per results and success. 

2. To a point you made within the proposal: good art takes time (you mention 16 pieces will take months) - I would rather you get the funding to begin this project as soon as possible (with quality art in mind) given we have a lot of great technical releases in process that could work alongside whyDecred.com in getting the word out/building community.

3. Speaking from a withDecred perspective, I think there is absolute collaboration that can be done synergistically with whyDecred. I really like the differentiated marketing approach (art+education+community+tangibles/merchandise) that whyDecred is proposing and think this has potential.

I applaud the ambition of building the ""means"" for those to attain Decred related items and merchandise.  This has existed in the past but until recently it has become more difficult with prior vendors discontinuing Decred related products. 

**Art Requirements:**

I echo linnutee's sentiment in this regard as there are lots technicalities involved in art production that seem to be absent from this proposal. Is there a **Production Outline** for the project deliverables and a **Production Schedule** for the completion of these 16 art pieces.  Without these basic requirements how does any stakeholder here know when they are likely to see their investment realised?

> 16 high quality art pieces

From the proposal I'm of the understanding that the production of these pieces will be outsourced?  Will the artist/artists responsible for the 2 past deliverables be responsible for the creation of the other pieces stated in this proposal? If not what is the **Vetting Procedure** for sourcing an additional artist?

Is there **Redundancy Capacity** if (for example) one of the artist/artists falls ill or can no longer work on this proposal?>

>  ""The Decred Treasury"" and ""Corrupt Bailouts and Handouts"".

I assume that you're Art Directing this project? I was curious if there was any preliminary documents outlining how you came to the style undertaken and how it correlates with or deviates from Decred's core communication messages of  being a *""Community-Directed, Superior Store of Value""* which is *""Secure, Adaptable and Sustainable""*?

**Licencing:**

This is a sticking issue as well.  Regardless of if the artists are outsourced or otherwise, they are their own sovereign individuals/entities: 

- What are the terms are they creating art within? 
- Where do things stand on the intellectual property front?

- Who is ""We"" in this instance? 
- Who are the parties involved and accountable here? 

**Business Plan:**

The Decred treasury is funding a profit making enterprise here:

> ""The art store is a component of this proposal""

I'm not against Decred Treasury funds being used to finance businesses that support communication of the project but only if there is a plan and transparency on the functioning and sustainability of the enterprise funded.  There seems to be a severe lack of documentation in this regard.

I requested further elaboration on this component through the submission of a **Business Plan** in the IRC #proposals channel however this has not been followed up so I am requesting this here on Politeia. 

**Conclusion:**

I believe that the merchandise store is an idea worth exploring.  However,  I'm not convinced this proposal is currently worth my vote based on the absence of the **components above**.

From org standpoint yes. It was convenient to have one contact person reporting on what the entire group was doing.

> How'd that go for us?

In retrospect I think it was a waste of money for the most part. We expected big presence in The Media mafia but it didn't happen. To be fair, the people were not faceless because they showed their faces quite a lot.

Note that we cannot put all blame on marketing initiatives that failed our expectations. Who approved it? We approved it. When you give power to the people they will make mistakes with it. But I prefer making mistakes with power than having no power. It was painful to burn so much money that could have been spent much better, but I think we learned from it. Notice how approval percentages for most marketing proposals have declined and claimed budgets have reduced. In other words, it is much harder to ""sell"" marketing services to the stakeholders than it was 1-2 years ago.

This proposal is trying a different strategy and cannot be compared directly.

> At best, the proposer is rehashing a narrative from 2009 that went stale a good 6 years ago

Just to make sure we discuss the same thing, the narrative I am reading in this proposal is that Decred is honest money with honest governance. I am not aware to what extent it was used since 2009 and what moment if it going stale 6 years ago do you refer to. It may sound naive and not exciting but I think it is a good one. The challenge is to deliver it. Do you have a better narrative to suggest?

> gas lighting people into believing the lie that this Little Mermaid ripoff artwork designed by clear amateurs

It is fair to criticize the quality/style of the artwork but this one is not helpful. See comments by mrbulb and linnutee that were much more specific about what can be improved.

> Their efforts have culminated in the price of DCR tanking to nearly all-time bitcoin lows, which is the only metric that matters in this industry.

You claim unprovable and unknowable causality without any research. What if we do fire all marketing people and continue sliding down to 10k sat for the next 2 years?

> Anyone can do it, and if you can't do it for free in a world where attention is driven by organic community activity, then you simply don't know the first thing about cryptocurrency valuation

This is hard to prove in general so we will have to trust one way or another.

One thing I would try is create an incentive to tell about the purchase.

The concern is not so much about Google knowing too much about your site. It is about protecting the visitors. Unfortunately, ""I just want to track the data, so let's inject a bit of these third parties, what could go wrong?"" is the default today and pretty much nobody questions this approach. But since you enter a geek community, here we go :)

The privacy aspect is that third party analytics fingerprint the hell out of the device and collect visit data. Modern browser bloat and sloppy defaults facilitate so many ways to track users _across_ websites with high accuracy.

The security aspect is that visitor's browser executes proprietary, likely obfuscated, third party tracking code that might contain bugs and security exploits.

The ethical aspect is, when I visit your site, it does not feel right if you invite a stash of third parties to snoop on our interaction that is supposed to be between you and me (or, my client and your server).

You could also manipulate Google Analytics by directing bot visits to your site. Both are not too trustworthy but I prefer first-party analytics. Good thing is that there are several open source solutions today.

True. The line may get blurry if authorities decide to exploit a known vulnerability in your system to confiscate the coins. Anyway, the point I was making is ""Cannot be confiscated"" may give a false expectation of absolute security.

1. If more people echo this sentiment of budgeting fewer pieces to start, I can amend my proposal to start with fewer pieces. So far you and checkmate have expressed interest in funding fewer pieces to start. What do the others think about this?

2. That is why we will hire many different artists, to go as fast as we can!

So sometimes these detailed works take some time to paint. Artists don't like to be rushed, and if they can enjoy and savor the process they can make better art. It is like making love, spending quality time and going the distance makes everything better!

How about instead of paying all the artists 900$, Everyone gets say 500$. So there is 6.4k saved. And we let all the artists know that 1 grand prize winner will be picked out of the 16 and they will receive 6-7k (or some other number). Make some kind of contest out of it to garner some extra attention. How will the winner be chosen? I am not sure. Could politeia be used? And as the voting ensues it would allow the artists to sweat the outcome and get more familiar with politeia. Not sure if you could do it based on likes/retweets or twitter voting since it can be gamed. 

Or just one big contest, perhaps on an art forum without hiring artists. Each piece of artwork that gets used on the website gets 200$. And perhaps we could do a politeia vote where we each pick 1 out of the 16 and the top three vote getters get 5k/3k/2k.
16*200=3200
5k+3k+2k=10k
total cost =13.2k instead of 14.4k

Some of this seems kind of involved but just throwing around some ideas.

These are great ideas! Making a contest sounds interesting. Conversations like this enrich the project so I thank you. Here are my thoughts:

* Maybe we can make contests and give away art reprints to the community, in exchange for some sort of engagement or work or activity! 
* If we make a contest and lower our payout to the artists, we would fail to attract many of the top artists. A few hundred dollars dramatically changes the quality of the art. The best artists are in demand and they might not participate for lower pay. 
* Better art will probably also sell more. I see it like Apple products, the artistic investment will be returned. I want you to be very proud about the art piece you hang on your wall!
* There is something special about making something the best you can, it is more inspiring. Trusting and going at it with everything you've got... this will help us inspire and convert more Decredizens. I would personally lose a bit of motivations thinking we are not making the best art we can. If I feel proud it helps me work at my best. I can't imagine myself being this passionate about XRP, for example.
* Artists could fail us, disappear or turn something awful. In these instances I would have to repay myself and start again with another artist. I would absorb this risk myself. I don't think this will happen but it could.
* There are many costs I am not billing directly, see ""Free Items for the Community"".
* I secretly plan to make more than the 16 art pieces with this funding, but don't tell anyone yet ;) I plan to add a surprise Meme section and have some top arts there too. The meme section would simply pump Decred in a more emotional way, not as squarely logical as the other pieces. I suspect these might be the best sellers of our art store.
* If we pay and attract top talent, and build a high traffic, famous site, we can later leverage this and our artistic reputation and have artists maybe work for less, in exchange of the status and exposure we can provide them. Maybe we can even attract art in the spirit of making the world better, for free. But for now I think we should pay and build ourselves first.

No, really: are we going to be paying an artist with a public profile such that — by mere act of doing the art — this artist will generate public interest in the artworks? e.g.

""*Wow, I wonder what Leonardo has been up to*"".

Because that would be valuable.

But even we were to assume that's what we're working with here — preliminary artwork looks quite underwhelming IMO — if it is valuable to have Leonardo da Vinci on board with us, why don't we just skip the middleman, and go direct to Leonardo?

What is the point of paying for yet another marketing website in a string of failed marketing websites?

For context, it is possible to go from our CLI tools (dcrd, dcrwallet, dcrlnd) to a working mobile wallet with several months of dev work that runs on both iOS and Android for roughly 60K USD.

Many of the features listed in the upcoming phase are highly complex features. Even though we will still get the benefit of building on already existing components, the UI's for these features will be complex and have few or no examples of other mobile wallets who have successfully done such an integration. It is uncharted territory, which many projects have avoided due to complexity. It is my belief that a user interface should not sacrifice powerful capabilities in order to remain friendly to average users. The two should not be mutually exclusive. This will require a great attention to detail and studying of user interaction to get right. It will require dedicated work. 

I agree the proposal limit is generous and this is intentional. As the founder of an accomplished team with a strong track record for Decred, I believe I have earned the trust of the Decred stakeholders to steward these funds wisely. I took into account the many factors for what would entail maximum output, including possible new team members to accelerate development speed, and changing market conditions within this 6 month commitment. The mobile development teams are currently spread thin in time availability as they have been taking on responsibilities in other projects. New developers will be needed which will require training / transfer of knowledge to occur. 

Perhaps most importantly, the proposal billing limit should not be considered the gold standard in judging the cost to value ratio of a product. The proposal billing limit is a safe guard put in place which is a commitment to a max bound. To be clear, the actual spend of this proposal may fall well below the proposal billing limit. We will aim to provide the greatest value to the stakeholders in order to maintain a long term relationship. Stakeholders need to be able to judge the cost of a product based on what is actually billed in arrears to what is delivered. With the stakeholders able to view billing reports and breakdowns on costs per product, they will be able to not just trust, but also verify. This information would be automatically generated directly from the authoritative CMS records, and should be available for all Decred products. From the broader view, this type of financial transparency in Decred will be key in competing against financial transparency portals offered by governments.",22d0c2ccd442446f9cc3884658757a4628df6fa3f2be70eabc8471dce98d07074f6b8a2a23ac43d08fe50ad16968e3113ee0917bed6578dc21890d39f252710e,eb82b264d3dad64ca85f5167f6bd5cf64897d546159cdb12303edd50cc7b47d1,14,64964d5c387a0e70825869f356845dd47fdef385f9bbf6c1f5998ab6092dbafbfb2e55db8f6fd9a6b85c4377309b4eda22aee4a80fe0bd9111a9b235fabc890b,1605209779,2,2.0,False,01ed6d12-2e09-4905-8135-33b863b8496b,raedah,

Questions:

1\. Does this budget include design expenses? Asking because these are already claimed by the [design proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/1dc1571) and I would like to avoid confusion we had with translations (where _three_ proposals included DJ translations in their budgets).

> Including the mobile apps in other apps stores

Good to see this. It is important because it will open access to individuals and communities for whom security and privacy are high priority, e.g. CyanogenMod, Lineage OS and other Android derivatives, and [maybe](https://liliputing.com/2020/02/linux-based-postmarketos-may-support-android-apps-thanks-to-anbox-pinephone-librem-5-and-more.html) even postmarketOS. This audience is much smaller than Google Play Store users but I expect to onboard much more sophisticated people from there. A person who deliberately flashes his phone with an alternative OS is more likely to appreciate the goals of Decred.

2\. Do you have any timeline for getting on F-Droid or running own F-Droid repo?

3\. Do mobile wallets work with proxies like Tor? Are there plans to test them in that mode, esp. when dcrandroid gets on F-Droid?

4\. I [asked](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/e5c8051d7426a754b3642aa2895839666a360abbdee3c1c1edd56ba152702875/comments/11) this in the GoDCR proposal but the question applies to both.

The app screenshots and the proposal showcase the app working with individual addresses, but does it work with extended public keys for accounts as well? 
With many pieces of the Decred stack, such as CSPP (maybe vspd, too?) relying more heavily on accounts rather than on individual addresses, not to mention the issue general of address reuse for privacy protection, it would seem unwise for the Treasury to pay for technology everyone else is working to phase out.

Apart from that, do you think there is any overlap between the functionality already developed for this app and something that can potentially be rolled into one of our other mobile releases by Raedah Group? With staking support for mobile and watch-only wallets in the works it sounds like functionality easily subsumed into DCR iOS or Android.

I see utility in a generic address watching app. Watching tickets voting is the most obvious use case. Watching Treasury is helpful to know when contractor payments are out. Watching own tipping addresses is helpful. There can be many use cases.

It could be extended a bit to show basic stats about Decred network without adding too much code. For example, show ticket price and ticket buying activity to assist with the decision if it's the perfect time for buying tickets. The watching system can be generalized to notify about a broad set of on-chain events.

Imo it is good that the app is working on per-address basis and is not storing xpubs, because mobile OS is generally not as secure as desktop.

My main concern is the privacy of this implementation. Personally I would not use an app that is sending my addresses to a central server. Below are some ideas to address this issue.

1\. At the very minimum, before first use it should show a privacy warning that all entered addresses will be sent to a central server and inform about using alternative servers (ideally of user's own control).

2\. The best way to implement address tracking would be to download cfilters from Decred network (or own specified node) and use those.

3\. The next best way would be to add a new endpoint to dcrdata that serves cfilters and use those, as matheusd suggested.

4\. The next option would be to add ""ad-hoc client-side address filters"" API to dcrdata and use that. The API could work like ""give me heights and hashes for blocks in date range X-Y, each with a list of addresses that received any funds"". If implemented efficiently, the app would consume 300-400 KiB traffic for one day of blocks. Just an idea, I think doing proper cfilter support would be better.

5\. Finally, even when sending addresses to dcrdata as is, exposure to a single central server can be reduced by making a configurable _list_ of dcrdata endpoints and using random endpoints from that list. There are a few dcrdata instances out there, and not giving _all_ my addresses to one would be an improvement.

Questions:

1\. What will be the UX flow for using the app with vspd staking, when all voting addresses will be different? And what if I purchase a dozen of tickets at once?

2\. Did itswisdomagain agree to do the thorough review?

3\. Do you have a timeline for adding the app on F-Droid or at least providing an APK?

> 1. What will be the UX flow for using the app with vspd staking, when all voting addresses will be different? And what if I purchase a dozen of tickets at once?

Currently, you would need to input every commitment address separately. I will make that at least a little easier with ""scan a ticket"", hopefully, so the address and an alias are fetched automatically. Do many people have twelve tickets? I mean, that's awesome, but they are already buying in batch, I don't know if this app would be as useful for them in the first place. I would need input from such a person to assess their needs.

Addresses should not be reused.

However, for the purposes of this app, addresses are all we have. This app is an outsider looking in. It could be changed to take an xpub and derive addresses from it and watch those addresses, but that is not part of this proposal. **That** functionality would certainly make more sense as part of a wallet app. Also, addresses are not something that are going to disappear. If you tell someone to send funds to ""xyz"", the funds must go to ""xyz"". Privacy obfuscates the path between the two, but in the end the address will get the funds. The same goes for a ticket commitment. It will be paid to the specified address.

As for putting it into the mobile wallet, in my opinion, watching arbitrary address is not the function of a wallet. The wallet only cares about addresses that belong to it. Does decrediton have the ability to watch random addresses? Also, if the mobile wallet did have staking, you would not be able to watch for tickets voting on your desktop or trezor wallets (unless you import the xpub). You would not be able to watch the treasury address (you could just open dcrdata though). I think this app has its niche here in that it doesn't care what it's watching.

And one more point, it's only three clicks to input an address: app -> ""+"" -> scan qr. And only two actions to delete an address: app -> swipe. If you were to embed this in another app it would increase the difficulty by some amount, which I think degrades the experience.",b48db8fc6288ea779fc82de55aae53a07d7480dd98f6ad3d4164911839737410e90e382adff9bd42b0d0adfcb50e536bdfb822de41e1e82ece43aee4d8b60a09,3b528e5d87f70c355118ff473c05334d7496f1df808208328626eee96770118a,2,f93235f509dfeac9bd6afaa0d6dc72b5720858f9d09493b1c45c96815e2d2b67fd1536e6a34541bbf7bfff89886bdbe8c2e314749e9ddeada5f1b0b4d1bd830f,1604966995,2,2.0,False,b7d9b286-6793-49f4-9a6d-4197747eec50,joegruff,

There's also the privacy (and bandwidth) consideration of requesting status updates for every address from dcrdata every X minutes.

A better alterative (IMO) would be to have your address scanner download the cfilters from dcrdata (this would require a new endpoint in dcrdata) and then locally scan the cfilters for the relevant addresses ([1] is an example usage of the chainscan library I wrote for dcrlnd that does just such a thing, albeit using dcrd as a backing node for the scans).

Since you already trust dcrdata (vs downloading and verifying the chain headers from the P2P network) I believe this would be an acceptable change.

For me, this is acceptable. It's what I do now and it is really very fast, just three actions. I urge anyone with tickets to try it out. It will be the only OP_RETURN (sstxcommitment) address for solo tickets and the second for pool tickets. Input it. Put an alias like 11/11Tik. Then press the star in the upper  right (this enables notifications) and you're set. When the ticket is voted/revoked you will know that the funds have returned to you. Wait 256 blocks and buy more tickets.

- The app should be made available on non-Google app stores such as F-droid (if it isn't already) for those who are on Graphene and outside of Google's survellience window.

I would argue the _first_ distribution method Decred apps should implement is self-built and self-signed APK because it is the fastest path to ""market"". The _second_ method should be F-Droid. Non-Google users are much more relevant for us at this stage. And only then bother with the Play Store.

> on android anyone can build from source and put the app on their phone

There is a huge effort gap between installing from F-Droid and building yourself (installing toolchain, getting sources, and resolving any issues).

> We can also distribute pre-built binaries from github

That is a huge convenience improvement over building from source. Make sure to generate signatures from the beginning because I see most projects ignore this step. Still, transferring the APK to the phone is an extra step that is not needed if it is in F-Droid or similar.

> It may be possible to put hints into decrediton, and maybe an extra ur code in dcrdata to make it easier to track tickets.

- no browser stack, no javascript, much less framework/library code from tech giants
- coin selection for tight control of outputs and possibly better privacy
- appreciate splitting mobile wallets and godcr into two proposals so that we can consider their budgets separately
- cost is reasonable, and I like the idea to reward the team for past work
- sponsorship is a good idea for three reasons: make sure library issues we face will get resolved, contribute back to Gio, and add to the image of Decred as a contributor to the wider cryptocurrency and open source ecosystems

> Including the mobile apps in other apps stores

Good to see this. It is important because it will open access to individuals and communities for whom security and privacy are high priority, e.g. CyanogenMod, Lineage OS and other Android derivatives, and [maybe](https://liliputing.com/2020/02/linux-based-postmarketos-may-support-android-apps-thanks-to-anbox-pinephone-librem-5-and-more.html) even postmarketOS.

A person who deliberately flashes his phone with an alternative OS is more likely to appreciate the goals of Decred.

I couldn't agree more. When I was doing the research to put this proposal together I jumped at the total projected cost of continuing to provide translation output in this particular area. As I figured the proposal would go through a round (or more) of feedback and discussion I thought I would include the maximum projected cost in order to see where exactly the stakeholders would like to see our output trimmed, which I would be more than happy to do.

I am going to reach out to our contributors to get additional information on their output in this area to get more granular data, because these figures were collected some time ago and I reckon we would all benefit from learning what exactly their focus was. I think that narrowing down the scope of work in whis particular area is of primary importance to make sure that only the most ""heavy-hitting"" content, for lack of a better term, is being worked on to provide the best cost-to-result ratio and prevent less-than-optimal spending.

Unfortunately, I must respectfully disagree on several fronts here.

For the total budget and esp. re: video assets translation, please refer to my reply to Richard's comment, which I hope sufficiently addresses this point. Moreover, as we can see by looking at the Treasury balance, something the website developed from your own proposal tracks, it shows growth and accumulation of DCR even in the face of the dropping exchange rate. This fact,  coupled with the fact that the proposal seeks to use the budget as the maximum cap for all translation-related operations and not earmarking all of it for spending, makes me confident that provided it is trimmed appropriately after receiving sufficient feedback from stakeholders it will be a decent addition to all current marketing and outreach initiatives, even after factoring in the fact that it is simply making a piece of on-going Decred operations  more transparent by bringing it to Politeia and explicitly asking for the approval of its budget and scope by the community.

> I also oppose the proposal and management fee. I have never seen this in other proposals and believe this kind of stuff should be labour of love and strictly unbillable.

Again, I disagree, but maybe I need to explain what I mean by this more clearly, but TL;DR, **this is not the cost of writing up the proposal**.
Having never managed a proposal that involves other contributors (or any proposal whatsoever, to be clear) billing against it I've requested additional funds to cover for work spent reviewing invoices made against it, making sure that expenses stay reasonable, deliverables are catalogued appropriately, and everything runs smoothly enough to avoid going over the prop budget.
There is work underway to implement proposal billing caps in CMS, I believe, but in case it turns out insufficient enough to do what I'd ideally want it to, and there is some need for manual review, I reckon 2 hours worth of work per month (tops) is a small price to pay for the value added.
As for your second point, degeri's approved [Decred Bug Bounty Program: Phase 3](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2170df6) cointains the following billing item:
> Any other non-bounty expenditure like emailing, bookkeeping, writeups, etc.

, which I see as a similar cost of operation, hence the reason for its inclusion.
I hope this clears up any and all misunderstandings.

As for the point about translation automation I agree, *it would be lovely* if a system like that existed, but unless you can point us to it or submit a counterproposal in this area yourself this is not the approach that we are putting forward here.
However, to expand on your point, which I think is very valid here, I don't know about other contributors, but personally I make use of CAT (computer-assisted translation) to cut down on work time and therefore reduce the cost extensively, and all my translation billings reflect the time it took to complete them **with** the use of CAT already.
As you say, machine translation is good enough to get the main gist across, a point which I believe I've already addressed in a different reply to a comment, but unreviewed, uncorrected for incorrect word choice, sentence syntax, stylistic devices, grammar, etc., and unpolished has no place in a project as professional as Decred.
Think of this, would you rather have a non-English crypto enthusiast or investor read a translation of one of your research papers translated by someone who knows the subject matter to try and do it justice, or one that was chucked into a machine which mistranslated highly-specific terms or messes up the syntax or context?
If our project-related output is forever, especially on the Internet, which goes double for the resources the Decred stakeholders are already paying for though proposal funding, I reckon they deserve to be done right.",8a8791a7cc054981fa2e3c93cd7ac9de36138decd587b212383e1a71f283d21352918ef65b86008ac357ce3c0e1b37640e94ab9a1cf839bdcb78e6f24240450a,49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd,12,c394b54acaa42f3f21719a4972882e5400f96cafa6b910aca1917aca826ea8d68b2ab71683bd6e9927bde38c62f2c31960cbfcb10ada0a65fead4cdbae128204,1602840188,1,1.0,False,b4a3e837-6636-41d7-bc2f-bc252fd961ee,kozel,

First, I would like to introduce myself:  I started working on Decred almost a year ago now with DCR Comic, a project we worked with Pablito not long ago. Currently, I am collaborating with different designs for the LATAM Marketing team, and I also collaborated in the UI of dcronchain.com.

I want to cover my experience about working on translations.

Before collaborating on YouTube content for Decred en Español, I came out with the idea of subtitling Exitus’ videos. I had honestly never done any translation work on video, so I completely ignored how long it actually takes: out of a 10 minutes video, it took me about 6 to 8 hours to finish.

The main reason is that in addition to the work of timing each phrase, it was the way to translate certain words, and I can only imagine that it may be similar in other languages:

When talking about 'Proof of Stake', in Spanish, the literal translation would be: 'Prueba de Estaca', where 'Stake' refers to the weapon 'stake', and not to the 'risk of betting on' as it really means in this case in particular.

And this is just an example, there are many other different cases that depends a lot on the context. This is the main reason why the translation quality is better than the literal translation performed by platforms like YouTube (at least in spanish)

However, IMHO I do not consider the translation work to be charged at the same rate as a designer or a developer. I think the job should be charged between 15/h to 20/h.

From my experience of doing 3 translations in 3 different videos, although translating video takes clearly more time than translating an article, I think we could at least review the hourly payment in this case.",e7ab1380236529ea24958f2533a0bf2aa3b7770a614024392c2422e1b83d0cdc5344fc5fe20493c09f39485950c5ea7b195d8d60892a108e983d798d28071609,5bc8f85fce716ed3474cb934bab485de68c8766ec7c2bbe386955e4542ca5765,13,2199d97ceb89ea7f2d7a3c0cde843f4f352de785973f714eac27ff2feac0e2d480fc45373dc4e8ddeccd2b77e39aef810caa1ac2992343155bb418c2d00c8c09,1602857426,1,1.0,False,31623fbd-9d80-46bb-9b69-3263a86af582,nachito,

- Translation efforts are required to reach the less technical users, specially in developing regions like LATAM. Formalization of a translation budget seems like a good step forward.
- Kozel and Bee have done an good job digging into current translation efforts, asking for feedback and documenting translations. While costly, I think this proposal covers much of the translation efforts and includes everything we should take into account to localize the project.

The worries:
- What to translate: Past discussions have pointed out that atemporal and user focused (not dev/tech focused) content should be translated. Example: While it might be an interesting read, I feel like most people in LATAM don't care about what the Federal Reserve is doing so that article isn't worth it.
-Translation vs. Localization: I'm worried that most translations are not having the impact they should because they are just translations. It would be better to localize content and fund content creation that better targets regional audience.
- Video subbing cost is not worth it. I believe subbing impact and the same amount could be used to fund simple remakes of those videos, spoken in other languages, not just with subs. Regional marketing teams could use those funds to develop their own content, fitting their own needs.
-Quality: The main issue with paying for translations has always been quality. I would only vote for a translation proposal that includes some kind of peer review and splits the budget between the reviewer and the ""main translator"". While I think $30/h is quite high (mainly because most marketing contractors who know the project can do the job), splitting it 20-10 for translation and review might yield good results and would vote for this kind of budget if it includes reviews.
-Platforms and tools: I see this proposal does not include any kind of plan to coordinate software localization which I think is a priority to onboard new users and also (sort of) helps develop a knowledge base with vocabulary specific to the project.

Good idea. I always recommend to have at least one reviewer (besides the main translator) to increase quality.

Good point to discuss.

Proposal owner needs to coordinate team members and report to stakeholders on progress and expenses (we rarely do this but we really should). The more people you have in the proposal, the more time it takes to manage them. Getting a multi-person proposal submitted is quite an achievement. Executing it is another achievement. Mind that once the proposal is finished and the plan/processes are established, the management overhead drops.

There is a reason why project managers get paid at all, and often _more_ than their subordinates. We need more strong leaders who can work for us. Thinking of ""company"" image, I would like them to know they can get paid here. The choice ""should I start a new team and manage it for free or just do some paid hours in existing proposals?"" is a dis-incentive to create new budgets and new ""jobs"" in Decred.

I appreciate if some contributors can afford to do it for free, but I do not oppose paying those who cannot. You are familiar with the challenge of low % of Decred time that gets billed :) Formalizing every extra bit helps, esp. if you depend on it for living.

There is a problem of excessive drain by management overhead in conventional orgs that we must prevent and we are adding measures for that. It is already possible for same-domain contractors to verify that proposal owner is not putting crazy hours for management, this is already extremely uncommon.

For me it is simply a question of cost and outputs.",4e2b4baea5b436523b140115447bcb590169ffcadf97e9b85aed850ca603ba14267913de8bf23a09e32765a0119b29897943891989e076c38531ad2eac6adc0a,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,17,875e9c47d2643ea016fad3a4e92d886b2e27a95e0417c46d537ec65b4b59ab72592a874210631989ad1f798d64a73375df30c1986903aff3d254a49e0a5d0502,1603753703,1,1.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

Liked:

- formalizing the expenses and making stakeholders aware of it
- expansion pool will avoid having to vote on small proposals if more contributors show up. When proposal owner has a good track record, it is better to have some spare budget that will not be used if not needed, rather than having to cut some work or do it for free because the budget was too small.
- management overhead is taken into account, this is a good practice imo (see my other [comment](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c093b8a808ef68665709995a5a741bd02502b9c6c48a99a4b179fef742ca6b2a/comments/17))

Ideas:

- to all translators, think of popular crypto/tech/finance/autonomy/etc blogs in your language, and consider submitting some of the translated texts there to break out of our bubble
- I am more confident in translations that have at least one reviewer. Now that we are formalizing this, it could be a recommendation or even a requirement in some cases.

- The US Marketing 2020 [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c830ea5) also includes funding for DJ. Does this new proposal effectively replace (take over) that part of the US proposal? These overlaps are confusing, it would help a lot to clarify that.

Personally, I think this is a great idea that plays well with the more recent push to increase the exposure for Decred content that the community and contributors produce, and something I've been trying to do and succeeded in doing on a few occasions with my regional crypto outlets, too. The key here is finding outlets which don't insist on a pay-to-play approach to publishing. The more people hear about and recognise Decred, the more open crypto outlets will be to publish our content to attract more traffic their way making such a deal mutually beneficial.

I can see why this is confusing
I was operating under the assumption that the LATAM phase 2 proposal handles the translation of the Decred Journal into Spanish, as the proposal states in its deliverables (and as I outlined in an earlier stage of the proposal). This was challenged on two occasions (once in the [comment](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c093b8a808ef68665709995a5a741bd02502b9c6c48a99a4b179fef742ca6b2a/comments/14)) by pablito, and once in a private DM. The whole thing grows more difficult to decipher when you take into account [dustorf's reply to a similar question](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c830ea5afea45a0aabf4092d1bea51fb10b8bfa2d8474aac03224f0f94d3d1af/comments/3) on the 2020 US Marketing and Release Coordination Budget, which states that the budget for the Decred Journal is inclusive of all translations.
However, earlier this year we were encouraged to put together a proposal that would serve as a budget for all translation initiatives (the DJ included), as putting all these efforts under one roof, so to speak, makes a lot of sense. 

It is for this reason that I believe that should this proposal pass, all Decred Journal translation expenses will be billed against **this** proposal (effectively replacing the 2020 US Marketing budget item for translation only expenses, which would still serve as a budget to *create* the DJ in the first place, in English), hopefully leaving more fuel in the tank in the budget of other props, and therefore the Treasury.

> * What type of video translation is funded here, a full voice over or text subtitles? Looking at the hours at first I figured it is the full voice over, but reading nachito's comment I'm not so sure.

This is another thing I would like to see a more formal approach making use of the ""best bang for the buck"" applied to. While I can definitely recognise the appeal of voicing over/subbing Decred content it is simply inefficient from a financial perspective. First, if there is no script, which for, let's say (most of) the Decred Assembly, or Deep Dive, or Decred in Depth there aren't, one would need to be created, and I know this in itself could be laughably expensive. Then there's the translation itself, and then the potential editing with synchronising timing, etc. In my opinion, while potentially attractive, this is not the best, so it's not something I would authorise as a prop owner (**note:** I hesitate to even use that term, because I would like the translation workgroup to make decisions collectively, but it needs to be put this way since there's probably going to be one person responsible for how everything turns out and I'm not one to rubberstamp inefficient spending).

What I would suggest we do in the first place is try to find relevant, high-quality content we already have English scripts for, like Exitus' output, which is usually on-topic and concise, and go from there. I could also potentially see transcribing scripts for more relevant and technical videos, like some of this year's Consensus Distributed appearances and then subbing those in several languages if there's demans, but that's to be seen.

Key takeaway when it comes to working with video material is this, **the less time it takes to get the material workable, the better**. It also goes without saying that amplifying the material the Decred community is already paying for would be of high importance, so there will be little love for rando ""here's 10 reasons why Decred will pump in 2021"" videos here.

Also, I want to note that just like with the rest of the proposed translation output, this is **strictly up to the translators' discretion.** Some people don't like working on videos, some dislike jargon-heavy texts, and there will be no forcing of anyone to do anything. However, if it is decided that something is worth translating and spreading further and someone is willing to do it, we'll have the means to do so.

> * Do you have a fallback person to manage the proposal, just in case?

Not explicitly, no, but as we've already discussed in private, and I'm sure most people will be delighted to hear, @bee has kindly offered his help where possible, but under no circumstance is he to be held accountable as a vice proposal owner. In any case, I'm glad to have your support on this one :)

> * What do you think about the idea to pay for word counts instead of hours, as suggested on Reddit? Is it feasible?

This is how it works in the translation industry, so I see no reason why we shouldn't at least try to implement such an approach here, because a flat rate would reduce the variation in compensation per deliverable. However, some tweaking would be required for several reasons, which, off the top of my head would be:

* payment for work is denominated in USD, but payable in DCR, so this would need to be reflected here as well (not xx DCR/word, as in the Reddit post)
* traditional translation is, I believe, in **fiat/word** or **fiat/character** (usually an agreed rate per xx word/chars), depending on the region, because longer words == more characters and shorter words == more words == more complex syntax
* how the text is structured needs to be taken into account, as you wouldn't just smack the raw Decred Journal into a word processor, count the words/chars and call it a day, because the text contains links and other elements of the format syntax that need to be preserved in the text but do not to be translated themselves, and the same goes for text structure in software files, etc., which makes estimating the size of the job trickier than it looks at first sight and requires some work in its own right 

Nevertheless, this is something I would definitely love to work out in order to make the playing field equal for all potential contributors.",e9eada9dfe3f1109bed5dd4523fb08c065632afbf9e7c54e221fe623d7c2c51ab7019aaacc96ac112f37cc3fa0103098ed2eed68ffce45f7eb2a4230a2b68402,49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd,19,b94407d736cea52efe36eb8d717a98de202921b188db3542a631fd9515f0baba33684b5ef929c27038ed84b0d7e932b5a4f433b862902bca5a3acee073401a03,1603972932,1,1.0,False,b4a3e837-6636-41d7-bc2f-bc252fd961ee,kozel,

re budget confusion, it does make sense to have a common roof for translations that didn't have a budget before. I wasn't sure about the other ones that had their own approved budget (Spanish via Latam 2 and likely Portuguese via Brazil marketing prop). I think them ""migrating"" to this proposal should mean that once it is approved, no billing for Spanish translations against Latam 2 proposal is allowed (otherwise it may be confusing and unfair). If the Latam team is ok with it I'm ok as well.

I like the ""best bang for the buck"" approach for video translations and in general.

> it's not something I would authorise as a prop owner (note: I hesitate to even use that term

There is nothing wrong about being a proposal owner/leader/manager. This role makes the difference between having a proposal and no proposal, and it is necessary to coordinate multiple people to execute efficently. I guess you don't like the term because of our strive for decentralization. If so, we should achieve it not by avoiding leaders as points of centralization, but quite the opposite, by having _more_ leaders that can build teams around them. Leaders do the legwork to get the proposals up for the benefit of stakeholders and contractors, effectively creating ""jobs"".

> because the text contains links and other elements of the format syntax that need to be preserved in the text but do not to be translated themselves

This is where writing originals in Markdown source helps. With access to the raw source you can copy it and replace English text with the target language while keeping the links. If all you have is HTML (e.g. Medium source), you need rich text copy-paste to work and it is easy to screw up the formatting.

Thanks for your questions.

* it's really difficult to estimate the numbers for the respective communities here, as I'm sure it would be for the whole Decred community (a question often asked at meetups, by the way). The best way to get a rough idea for it would be to look at meetups, for example, which before C19 were quite common and regular in Poland, and I wish I could have attended more at that time. More than a way of catering to an already existing community, which is fine in its own right, I personally see this initiative as a way of reaching out to potential newcomers to crypto, as a wealth of knowledge about a project can help attract and ease them into it.

* nothing is stopping people from using automated traslation, and I'm sure many do, but there are some aspects where a _good enough_ translation that gets most of the gist across is, well, not good enough, e.g. official recources, websites, marketing briefs and materials, etc. There are many things automated translation is still struggling with, and I'm sure there'll still be plenty of time before all the kinks are ironed out, as languages just keep changing. Besides, the few times that the Decred Project  tried to crowdsource translations I believe it was found out that machine translation was used in quite a lot of them, which unfortunately produced sub-par results. Good translation comes from not only a good command of a language, but also a deep understanding of the subject matter, which I believe most Decred contractors have demonstrated so far.

* this is true, and while I have done a few meetups and presentations in English in my own backyard, they were mostly for a more technically-savvy audience, and I think underestimating the aspect of availability of resources may hinder local community-building initiatives, which so far have been pretty successful in the case of BR and LATAM. I don't expect everyone who displays values similar to those help by the Decred Project to be able to speak English; in fact,  strong regional communities are an example of a step towards further decentralisation.

While I'm grateful for your questions I respectfully disagree that the budget we ask for is way too high. I have made several efforts to highlight the fact that this is the maximum budget for this initiative, which also considers the opportunity to expand it further, and all funds which are not spent will remain in the Treasury, with possible additional caps on individual spending to minimise the burn rate. Unfortunately, the numbers I've given are based on incomplete data, as not every contributor contributed work in all areas outlined by the proposal, and the total is an extreme extrapolation of what it would roughly cost if all contributors were to put in the average amount of work in each aspect of the proposal per month. While I don't believe we would come close to exhausting the budget completely, the amount asked is a measure against going over a more modest but accurate spending projection, like the one we've witnessed in the case of at least one past proposal, which is something I would personally like to avoid .

Moreover, if you have suggestions on what you would like to see scaled back or removed I would be happy to hear them as long as they are concrete and specific.",1f0503aa63bb185c66201d3960be0a7ed82b916f83fb5d58cc8a24a6e5fcaa66a0d256854183690d7ed24551415cf691ae731d74d90c04f5a1d2b2a4882ddb0e,49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd,6,af202fabddb65025d6a774ed5b7224f6272181c51e491ccbd6ed0d200fe0a1b0474b675ae81dd6d4d15375ff3880a73d4fd175f061659890b70dc8c0cc99000f,1602610998,1,1.0,False,b4a3e837-6636-41d7-bc2f-bc252fd961ee,kozel,

I follow what you have done with the budget calculations and appreciate that they are (in some cases extreme) maximums. The video bucket is fairly eye-watering though, at $20,790 for 6 months that's more than the cost of Exitus' video production proposal. I gather that the video content is being translated in 2 languages now. Unless you think it's likely to expand to 7 soon after the proposal is approved, the budget is likely to be much too large. It might be worth trimming, as I expect you might catch some No votes from stakeholders who see the $20k for video translations figure and do not follow the reasoning for it being that size, or the reasons it's unlikely to cost that much.",b9b56bd690709e1b8fc88114160b864b267aed55169c6fb162283ef4ae4898626a21604a6ec0d7a4ce789220a2ae16c90727d6b3bcf64d06b043c3b36f539000,cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e,7,c4438513e1ad2fc8493d5e8ca47c0fe4242595c6da8744508031ebf3b48c1fdc67d4bdfc468d7cda98514306351899d39a0a2a117b4b150883006ddd6e96b309,1602719526,1,1.0,False,350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c,richard-red,

New people were welcomed into the chats, questions were tirelessly answered and help was given with onboarding the software. As we all know this trend has changed. Decred steps towards the promise of the DAO, the pressure has increased. Online campaigns became the tool of choice, contacts with publishers and journalists were expanded and professional PR agencies were hired. My personal experience has shown that direct personal contact, presence at meetups, talks and active discussion is the most effective way to get new people interested in Decred.

The community continues to produce an outstanding output, the supporting performance in my opinion does not come from obscenely overpriced PR placements. If you compare the quantitative and qualitative output Grassroots/PR with the costs, 6 month/magazine placements can translate the complete Grassroots output for 3 years and make it more accessible internationally. Providing a proper history, documentation, UI/UX and key articles in international form can greatly reduce the barrier of first contact.

Fair. Everyone has equal access to buy and mine Decred generated by a preset, smooth emission rate. Stakeholders approve consensus changes and manage

Sound Money. Digitally scarce, only 21 million DCR will ever be created and the supply is verifiable. An innovative hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stak
e system that layers security protects the network.

Built to last. Decred is designed to continuously adapt over the long run -- to resist forks, improve the technology, and evolve per the will of stake
holders. 10% of each block reward funds Decred's treasury, to compensate contributors for their work through a formal proposal system.

Your suggestions make sense for a technical audience, but for the general population we need to keep it simple. Right now, the aim of this proposal is to keep the 3 boxes the same (so [our video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjZwWD0pDzw) still makes sense) but to add an introduction that will hopefully resonate with a wide range of people:

```
We live in disruptive times.

All around the world we see protests, pandemics, rising unemployment and massive money printing.

Our future on this planet is uncertain. To create a better future, we need to evolve money.

The evolution of money requires global collaboration. This is why we need Decred.

Decred is a decentralized, autonomous organization (DAO). We develop crypto technology for the public benefit.

Useful applications created by Decred include: Atomic Swaps, DEX, Politeia, the Lightning Network.

Instead of coins or cash we use DCR (decentralized credits), a modernized version of money.

Everyone can stake DCR to vote on major decisions and earn rewards.

Together we make sure that the project is Secure, Adaptable, Sustainable.
```

We agree that ""evolve per the will of stakeholders"" doesn't read well. Perhaps we could edit the text within the 3 boxes to make them more readable, but I think the titles should stay the same (so they match the video).

1) Put the Fair string at the top, so, it's the first thing newcomers will see, I believe it can get more attention than the string Secure.

3) In the Fair description, 

""Decred is governed by its stakeholders, who time-lock some of their decentralized credits in exchange for tickets, using these to vote and make decisions about the Decred network and DCR asset's future.""

Would be great to let the people know that by time-locking their DCR, they will get income from the mining reward because of their vote and getting involve with the community.

""Stakeholder-Governed Sound Money for a Fairer Financial System"" is indeed a slight improvement to the existing copy, but it doesn't inspire me. It doesn't excite me about the project. It feels like you are trying to describe Decred, but using the wrong words.

My main points of criticism:

1. Every crypto project is governed by stakeholders. Think about it. Especially when using a wide definition of the term stakeholder: benevolent dictators and three letter agencies are also considered stakeholders. This doesn't make Decred stand out among other projects. The defining characteristic is HOW the project is governed, which is something to explain when people are already warmed up (not in the first line). 
2. I had to search for a definition of sound money. It is not a familiar concept, I don't think this term will resonate with newcomers. IF you take the time to search for definitions via duckduckgo, it says: ""*Sound money is money that is not prone to sudden appreciation or depreciation in purchasing power over the long term*"" and ""*money not liable to sudden appreciation or depreciation in value : stable money*"". It seems the word ""sound"" does not really apply to DCR in this definition, because the price at which DCR was valued has changed significantly over the last few years.
3. The suggested messaging also prominently mentions ""fairness"" which is a questionable word choice. The question ""fair for whom?"" is relevant here, because ""fairness"" is subjective. Decred voting is controlled by early adopters who bought DCR at a low price, this may feel unfair for people who join later. The price of DCR may go down, which will feel unfair to those who bought in at higher prices. Whether it is fairer than the current system really depends on your personal experience. 

All in all, it seems the suggested messaging is aimed at people who already understand the project and its fundamentals. If the aim is to strengthen the existing community it may be the right move to pass this proposal. However, I think the homepage should address newcomers as well. Otherwise it will be difficult to grow Decred beyond the DCR bubble.

<< There is a missing highlevel paragraph explaination here that defines the concept **money evolved** that bridges to the **characteristics of that concept**, _fair_, _adaptable_, _secure_that should sit under the tagline. 

Right now you're jumping two stages of explaination and it's abrupt and there is no logical flow.

From there you can outline the three boxes. 

_**Fair**_

_The Decred network is available to all, and the rules are the same for everyone. Decred is governed by its stakeholders, who time-lock some of their decentralized credits in exchange for tickets, using these to vote and make decisions about the Decred network and DCR asset's future._

I think points 1 and 2 are good ones, and I also had reservations about ""Stakeholder-governed sound money"". I'm happy to go with something like ""Money Evolved"" as the tagline.

> Decred voting is controlled by early adopters who bought DCR at a low price, this may feel unfair for people who join later. 

That's a fairly negative way to put it, because people who bought DCR early at a low price got no voting power unless they staked it, and only maintained their voting power if they kept staking and didn't sell (despite periods of significant price appreciation). If you have some numbers for this level of control please share them, because I've been working on this kind of question and I'm finding it quite difficult to quantify precisely. In any case, as long as everyone followed the rules, which we can be well assured that they did because of the blockchain records, their relative level of influence now after 4.5 years can be reasonably approximated to be ""fair enough"", imo.

I agree that ""fair"" is a controversial term, but I think it's one that Decred can reasonably lay claim to, for the reasons outlined in the page copy. For me it's fair because it operates on clearly communicated rules that are the same for everyone. I'm not expecting to get rug-pulled or for the network to develop in a direction that's not aligned with the majority of stakeholders' wishes. The price doesn't have to go up for the network to operate fairly, the proposition is that stakeholders demonstrate their skin in the game and suffer (or enjoy) the consequences of their decisions in terms of the value of DCR. I don't see how it could be a ""fair game"" if it can guarantee price appreciation.",46e9d261dce7e64081e4e361fdc435ef1835e58fa668f1ef117672727f1aa7ee20febce37e92523b1246ac2ec08a60ad858bc15fb1297aef1debdf463f49860c,cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e,18,43d00774596167bd3ad6fa79f6f2817636756ac9682501a4f0b006a0daae1c10862a8bdba10ede6d17228a0594ba7d60df14a091713ad0f1105473612180ce0e,1601487973,1,1.0,False,350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c,richard-red,

Decred.org currently exists as the single most important entity for learning and spreading awareness about Decred simply because it is the **main link** from big Crypto-currency websites like CoinMarketCap, Coingecko etc which have tens of thousands if not **hundreds of thousands of viewers daily**. Every time Decred pumps you better believe curious eyes are checking out decred.org to learn just what the heck Decred is and why they should care. Furthermore, basically all of our marketing points to decred.org as a source to learn more about the project. It is imperative the website’s landing page be welcoming, clear, and insightful enough to keep new viewers hooked to dive deeper.

With that said, and with 1.6.0 coming I believe the landing page of decred.org should clearly list:

- Decred’s unique features like the DEX, Privacy, Lightning, DAO, Politeia etc
- State that Decred is its own blockchain and codebase (not a fork).
- State that there are only 21 million coins and list the current amount in circulation
- List the amount of coins & percentage of coins staked. (Think dcrdata and how it’s displayed beautifully there).
- List the current amount of Decred needed to become a Stakeholder with a link “How to become a Stakeholder”.
- Explain in plain English why Decred is “Evolving Money” (If that’s the chosen tagline).

**Most importantly, empathize the Stakeholder element of Decred. Stakeholders make the rules. Stakeholders control the Treasury. Stakeholders get rewarded for securing the protocol etc. Promote being a Stakeholder. “You can become a Stakeholder too”. Get people hooked.**


I also feel the current landing page is a bit too “paragraphy” and isn’t exactly welcoming to somebody who just wants a quick 30 second pitch of what exactly Decred is. We’re overthinking all of this.

The one thing I've tried to open up is you have to be careful about emphasis in terms of what Decred *is* since the thrust of this proposal is that Decred is *all* of the things you mention and **together** they create a Revolutionary Institution (my initial version didn't have decentralised, but for now it feels necessary). 

This approach abstracts away as much as possible in the explaination, without cutting off people who don't get the sound money language or anything else that is part of the system design allowing all of those 'features or components' to be further explained in further steps. 

If you add too much you get a word salad that appeases one area, whilst closing off conversation to newcomers - right now sound money will easily appeal to the vast majority of existing stakeholders, but is that what is needed to break out of the bubble?

For example many people use 'DCR' and 'Decred' interchangeably to describe the money piece of the system. Is $DCR the token/asset/currency/commodity, the money bit? Is Pi part of the monetary system? 

When we compare the Federal Reserve and the USD. Which bit is the institution (the whole system) and which bit is the money? 
When USD was backed by gold, was this not the 'sound money' bit? 
Was the Federal Reserve itself called 'sound money'? 

Working with your suggestion: 

## A Revolutionary Decentralised Institution 
*Decred's system is designed to protect against lost of purchasing power, empower individual freedoms and build a fairer financial system'*

Then you get into 'sound money' in the next step where you explain **how** Decred protects against a loss of purchasing power... through sound money, which can then step into further detail such as the predictable issuance / detail.

The issue is that right now Decred does not protect against a loss of purchasing power since it has been steadily losing value in USD terms. In that regard, this trait is a hope for the future and isn't a claim that can be made today with any credibility.

However when you stick it all together into a bundle, you do have something that looks and feels very much like a revolutionary institution.",89190d94040575a8bd56e498cf853ceffa2bd6304cf6d7ca8f7860b3ece4dc84d184efaa64c1a7ae1c3869a5ee550eb047aa9849d8632f94b48a09ef23a2ee0d,e0b17a0e47a987c30451df36bea7237604b9adc022bf791dd8c12ce597757dc9,2,d18ed749e8c2cc3f3dfaf328898c27faad8df9e3cdb5414fd39c108783d24fedf490b22b7498d9651fb21dd7f62d6f9b277c56e7e9dc7a179a89ccc63c543501,1601310279,1,1.0,False,9f00b29e-1b51-4f28-a5e0-c9c1adc959b9,mrbulb,

However, from what I've seen in this proposal (and based on some personal evolving thoughts on the future of marketing Decred) I'm voting **YES** to this proposal for these reasons:

**Approach:**
- This approach is aggressive, but tasteful - within boundaries of what I'd consider ""Decred quality / expectations"" 
- Along this vein - the aggressive approach is something that's been lacking within the project because we've always viewed it as tacky / prohibitively expensive. This looks like a quality approach to get out there and cut through the incessant noise in the crypto space
- This marketing approach pairs two things Decred advocates care about: (1) Education and (2) Tech

**Team:**
- Team is tenacious and excited about doing the work: have already done test trials, built the site for free, and constantly ideating
- Team is competent and already familiar with Decred

**Cost**
- $1,000 / month is cheap for experimenting with a new marketing tactic

- Website homepage: I'm sorry to hear that you left after 2 seconds. But I also wrote that not everybody will like the website. What is important for the success of the project is following: If we send to the website newcomers to learn about Decred and we collect feedback from them (one-on-one is best; or we derive the feedback based on measured data), we can improve the content step by step to achieve good successful onboarding rate (people who read it want to buy some DCR).

- We had a conversation today on Twitter rg. the attack cost (thanks for everybody who participated). After reading it, you will see (as me) that the topic is a bit more complex and using such extreme charts as linear comparison in the current state might work for some people, but may have more drawbacks. I would rather like to create fair comparison with all the context and publish such content. I talked today to Luke and we will improve that comparison after his priority tasks are finished and shipped.

- Rg. naming of the website, I explained my reasoning in the FAQ section. I'm not sure if you read that. I discussed the naming with few people, then we made the decision.

- Thanks for the suggestions rg. non-KYC exchanges, I will certainly add them to the ""Buy"" page.

- Thanks also for the last suggestion, it might be good to point out what you can already purchase withDecred.

Also note that this is only a part of awareness strategy which we want to execute. If this approach works, we will continue doing it. If it doesn't we will not continue. 

I mentioned already that I'm pretty much agnostic to which channel works, I want to help find an awareness strategy that works.

thank you for your comments. I want to be honest when I say that I know this sole activity will not solve everything, but is an effort to rejuvenate the community, activate existing members to interact more on Twitter and help us bring new stakeholders to Decred community.

There is an extended plan being worked on in the background with several additional well-known community members and we will unveil next concrete activities soon.

I want to encourage everybody to listen to my reasoning and thoughts in the Staked podcast which was published today. I talk about how we can achieve bigger network effect with simple activities.

1. For now we assume the strategy ""tag your friends"" which will bring in new people. We already had people who are quite new to crypto in those comments. Imho, important is then to interact, eg. welcome them with additional comment. We started including country flags if we knew which country they are from, which immediately creates [small] relationship. We will think about more stuff on the go and experiment. Eg. we can also try ""tag someone who is not following @withdecred/@decredproject yet"".

1. Focus/channel: In recent months, every time when there were more ""bulky"" marketing proposals with less clear plan, there was a pushback by the community of ""make it more clear"". This is one of more proposals coming with goal to isolate budget and focus on one specific channel and tactic per one proposal.

2. I love that you posted the suggestion of potential new channel to try! I am familiar with Twitter, I am familiar with fact that this strategy work, I know how to execute it properly. I am also looking at publish0x and Quora - please, do come forward if you have experience with these or other platforms which we can experiment with. Eg. Exitus mentioned 4chan.

We are working on this in our free time besides full-time job, we can't cover everything. Saying that, I encourage other people to step-up and create new proposal for other channels! I will gladly help brainstorm ideas if needed.

3. I put ""Stakeholder-governed sound money"" on website intentionally as a) It seems to have good support in core community (Matrix), and b) we can test it with newcomers and ask/watch new people in Discord/Telegram - how they respond to it. Whatever the RFP process will end up with, we will sync-up this site with the new messaging.

My feelings are very much agnostic to which channel(s) and which strategies will eventually work. My goal is to help find the right channels + right strategy to achieve sustainable growth model.",4efdc7c9913d3b333b597b67d542fca0011b49a2684fba85eb351d1eda9aa6a6ab993804f48777a8b31e06745d171078a679f6539eabf3f0e3fe066a86db4307,ab30c62fdee8ec6e89429481acd652a3501d166383ffd46b57fd9d65a4d2b138,7,494120bb988afd800c433bf144a4be85ba02113c1b33e8f0c47b568f615a2386ee027bc142800e29e073a9d87438ea6a3230fdcd0116a1a816fedac5254e9a00,1600364494,1,1.0,False,e11fbdb2-f47f-4524-ae0f-a9ce96538517,pavel_,

It's important to note that the costs for this proposal are all directly going towards the cause. This idea is to spread the $DCR network effect via an **earned giveaway**.

**You can set a better goal.**

I like where this effort is going. Here are some ideas.

- when I visited this website I didn't stay more than 2 seconds on it, didn't read any of the articles, and didn't plan to come back.  I came back by accident when I clicked on the proposal under Governance and thought ""Oh, this is that?"" If the front page didn't have 303 words on it but only 5, ""Decred is better than Bitcoin"", the message would be 60x more potent and would make me stop longer than 2 seconds. 

- if you add the ""linear scale"" image https://twitter.com/Ammarooni/status/1307716509071011844 on the front page I can see why Decred might be better *without spending any time to read anything*. I get the main point in less than 5 seconds. Now you have me 5 seconds on the website.

- I didn't like the Twitter handle @withdecred much but maybe it's ok. It sounds like picking teams - you're either with us or without us - a recipe to divide a community. @usedecred might be better and it tells me what to do with Decred. I'm not supposed to think hard if I should buy and hold it for investment, I'm supposed to use it. Or @buydecred.

- if the site has a link with the price, how many Decreds I get for one Bitcoin, and a link to some non-KYC exchange where I can get some right now, like https://swapspace.co https://godex.io/, then between seconds 6 and 10 I could be thinking of buying.  This is better than spending 21 minutes to read articles or closing the browser tab.

- add a link to something I can buy with Decred or to least one store that accepts Decred. I can buy plane tickets and gold with other coins.",abfc556b9af1139fbdfea0c2667c9e547fc76f203e0302f3667e42d3487127babe5a9ece32e1dce3e289bf6f87185499f6e94154c0146276d2885da05d3b9a0f,c2a61bde5331bc52a7f83bb4d0e7f2d20909b3a6877cc1bbc4e17c03ea300eac,9,cf7a37d854aefd7025e9558ba3f2429ff5957fdbf1967df1fb6746ac2ea044a875788ecddffcb1c69dc80f6ec8a00c2b314505d1b27f74464cd57eb6a858d00d,1600639421,2,2.0,False,c140130c-1257-415d-837f-7ff13e64eb42,uncertain_about_tomorrow,

Whatever we do, the words ""Money Evolved"" should be used in promotional/educational material regularly in some way, shape, or form.

The words ""Sound"", ""Strong"", or ""Secure"" could be used interchangeably.

""Sound"" is less Chad and more intellectual, but since it's only one syllable, it works. Bitcoin has done quite a bit to spread awareness on the concept of ""Sound Money"", albeit I feel still not enough for no-coiners. Nonetheless, it's relevant enough and simple enough to use.

Two of my rules for deciding something like a domain name or brand name for a consumer audience is that it should be no more than three syllables in its entirety, preferably two, inclusive of all words. And, it should also be idiot-proof to spell, and stupidly easy to pronounce over the phone to someone on a bad line even when spoken by a variety of international accents. ""Sound Money Evolved"" and even ""Money Evolved"" breaks these rules, however we're talking about a tagline here, not a name. ""Money"" is two syllables already, yet is short enough, ubiquitously known enough, sexy enough, and easy to pronounce.

A few months later (after a lot of shitcoinery and research) I bumped into it again and it all clicked, taking me down the rabbit hole.

When I was coming up with my own taglines incidentally I always used the word ""evolving"" too. The only word I'm not entirely sure of, is ""sound"", just because I'm wondering about the general public familiarity with it. I wish the people who originally came up with the term chose a more ""chad"" word, like ""Hardened"" or something like that. Anyway, it's a strong candidate for a tagline, the best one yet. Other than that, this Proposal can be seen as a dividing line between old and new messaging, it can be a reboot button to all of DCR marketing. It really touches upon the essential point: it's the whole ""spirit"" of the messaging that has to change. All other messaging proposals I have seen - even though they're good and one can see a lot of effort has been put into them - they suffer from a kind of inability to draw people's attention. The messaging has to be concise and powerful. It has to exude dragon energy.

That's just the name of the proposal though, that string doesn't appear anywhere in the proposed site copy and the proposed tagline is just ""Stakeholder-Governed Sound Money"".

I think you're right about keeping it simple, and ""Sound Money Evolved"" might well be better and catchier than ""Stakeholder-Governed Sound Money"".

> Now it's time to go off the rails a bit... Words like ""sustainable"" and ""fair"" are virgin words that put us on the defensive right off the bat and associate us with SJW snowflakes.

While you have a point here about words which can put us on the defensive, I think it makes sense to take a strong position on ""fairness"" because some of the main arguments against a system like Decred's (the PoS component) are about this. Decred has taken steps to mitigate the aspects of PoS which are seen as unfair (rich get richer dynamic or digital feudalism), and to address the lack of fairness associated with systems that give developers or miners much more say than users. It also feeds into things like DEX, you can make a pretty compelling argument in a couple of pages that Decred has considered its position on what's fair and this feeds into how the project is set up and what it does.

Another way to look at it is that there's competition for a lot of these ""strong"" terms, how many projects are aiming to make some sort of ""sound money""? From what I have seen there are far fewer projects competing on a concept like ""fairness"", or if they are they're not strong competitors (have you seen the DeFi version of a ""fair launch""?). Fairness is also a concept that will I think resonate more strongly with different people than the ""sound money"" concept, and if we're looking to grow a community finding people who aren't already super into Bitcoin or Ethereum or some other crypto project is important in and of itself.",8b9553ad1732d2788170a33836e085a6f374d0b1acde47e1efb1132094fec676f7a270a52459dc482757165e7841b41add63d766885134ffd110815934c67f0c,cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e,8,2baafe294aeb5cde62b5d30e4a1269284da1ad90fae8e8667caab2307b0085d8e91b5fa4acd5d71062225b49fb8b3b337631ce6ada97082c1ce71a0294dd410b,1601303457,2,2.0,False,350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c,richard-red,

At no point did we tell him or otherwise give the impression he would be paid for work apart from work he explicitly invoiced for, which must be itemized.  Despite giving him an opportunity to contribute as a contractor, he never billed and was never able to meaningfully collaborate with any other contractor.  Once it was clear he was a bad fit as a contractor, we removed him from the contractor chat and ended the relationship.

At this point, he became incredibly irate and began to actively disparage the project publicly on social media and anywhere else he could.  This went on for roughly 2 years and then slowed down in late 2019.  Since I was not the one who originally invited him to be a contractor, I have been stuck in the unenviable position of dealing with a problem someone else created several years ago.  It was never my intent to bring him in as a contractor in the first place, so terminating the relationship was simply a matter of acting to protect the project.

Most of alexoz’s negative behavior has already been outlined by other commenters, so I will not dwell on it.  The activities alexoz engaged in for which he is seeking repayment were neither approved by project contractors nor did they, to the best of my knowledge, meaningfully contribute to the project.  In light of the 2+ years of disparagement the project has experienced, if anything, alexoz should have to pay the project for the bad publicity he generated.

It is an awful idea to pay alexoz, considering his history with the project, and I strongly recommend stakeholders vote against this proposal.",81bc462b9f7b8b8e109589c85daddcaeeb1668d595a60bb52428e2b45c6575b839d7ceddc1b7e67fa36d39a70c6a367c45830e6cc10efd16f533e22fa1e4380e,e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360,48,9ea5d56b7ad3a8e82c90249946a2e26949de6884898eeb149a566ae6a36b8cf4594e836319b9e820bd190419c9d013b8459997b986b08a21440c1a9e9a243b06,1601247804,5,5.0,False,fe62dd6a-2cc6-4d41-abd0-522528d33ae7,jy-p,

Found this article here [Decred A Financial Revolution](https://medium.com/@alexsolo/decred-a-financial-revolution-b806886c1bda) on Medium from 2016, and honestly I don't like it, because it looks incomplete.

The Decred DAO page on Facebook does not create any regular content. Just Reposts, links and other stuff that I do like it, but I don't think it's enough to be billed, since most people (including me) do it because we have skin in the game.

Attracting new members to the community is valued by me and other project contributors, but we do it because we have skin in the game. Billing for introducing new members to the project, without any explicit good quality content creation, any statistic, any report open doors for scammers to bill for any made-up jobs.

The Decred ""offer"" is a blockchain where your transactions cannot be censored, not a public speaking space free of censorship.  In fact there are currently no real public speaking space free of censorship maintained by a public project, for the simple reason that speaking or expressing ideas is usually linked to our meatspace identities and these identities have to deal with their physical locations. (laws, and all that stuff).  The same way, this proposal system, is not made to prevent censorship (because invalid or ""illegal"" proposals get censored by necessity. However a censorship token act as proof for anyone to demonstrate they were censored. That's the best thing we got at the moment using timestamped data to the blockchain. And that got nothing to do with Slack.

So you got banned from Slack.  And if I recall correctly (because it's been a very long time), you got banned not for your opinion, your ideas or your speech, you got banned for posting a DCR address in a public chatroom to receive funds. At the time, it was an auto-ban because it was the year of the ICOs. The amount of scams and bots posting addresses everywhere was a plague. So the rule was tightly enforced.  I can't tell if the ban came from an overzealous mod, or just a simple reflex action. But your own reaction afterward on twitter and any place where you felt necessary to call ""SCAM"" at every occasion, clearly showed that, your ideas and opinions were not censored.

Participating in Decred and getting paid is not a right. It's a privilege that requires the trust of other contractors and stakeholders. There is just no way around this until there is no longer requirement for a social layer for the project to function. (If that is even possible)  And while we have a social layer,  it's your personal responsibility to tend to your relations with other members and contributors if you want to be part of it.

Although ""Decentralized Credits"" is the origin of the name ""Decred"" I would caution against featuring it too prominently. We use the term ""Credits"" here in the sense of ""An arbitrary unit of value"" (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/credit#Noun). However, in common usage (perhaps more so in the US), ""credit"" more commonly carries the idea of a delayed payment (i.e. credit card, buying on credit, creditworthiness). It is my concern that if we feature ""Decentralized Credits"" too prominently, it may be a source of confusion leading people to believe that Decred is some kind of cryptocurrency lending/borrowing platform.

I am supportive of the proposal as it is with reasoning behind the tagline:
Stakeholder-Governed --> This is a true representation of what Decred is and how it functions. It also capitalises on differentiation and is tangible enough for both retail and institutional eyes.

Sound Money --> Soundness is actually unique in cc core messaging and few projects can viably 'lift' it as we have seen unfortunately in the past. Money that is sound and governed by stakeholders leans into the analogy Ammar has brought to light with the similarity with the Special Drawing RIghts (SDR) currency. This is an important framework in my opinion especially for the institutional appeal.

Fairer Financial System --> All the above + Secure, Adaptable and Sustainable are pushing for the ultimate goal of building a fairer financial system. From the currency to the applications, this is what Decred is building and it is important to set it up front and centre. This is a message people of all backgrounds can rally behind and it could not be more precient.

What = Stakeholder-Governed Sound Money
Why = Create a Fairer Financial System
How = By being Secure, Adaptable and Sustainable.

The other side of it is that we're already somewhat committed to ""credits"" because otherwise ""Decred"" doesn't have much meaning.

Embracing the money aspect of Decred will do wonders to explaining $DCR as an economic asset. Here are a couple of ideas for consideration: 

- We may be well served by communicating that Decred is more than a currency - it is also a DAO. Instead of competing with traditional cryptocurrencies solely on the '*sound money*' front, Decred has a chance to carve out a leadership position on the DAO front. Decred can compete in this vector in a way that other ccs can't.
- There is an opportunity to feature notable media assets like Decred in the news (from the PR work), or the many Decred research papers, journals, and video clips.

I appreciate the time taken here to draft up your proposal and the creativity behind it however I can't bring myself to vote ""Yes"" on this proposal in it's current form.  This sounds like a great community activity that could be undertaken by those who express an active interest in Poker and who are willing to organise on these platforms however the requirement for participation being:

- 1. having an account on a 3rd Party Gambling Platform.

is quite problematic in my eyes.

If any changes can be made to remove this prerequisite this proposal would certainly be a more appealing community engagement activity proposal in my eyes. 

Regardless, good luck on your first proposal!

Appreciate the idea and the fact that you are volunteering to administrate the game without expecting any compensation. I think it's a refreshing idea and although Poker is inherently  tied to ""gambling"", you smartly put it into a casual game that rewards the top player at the end. Therefore, there really isn't any gambling involved per se, but that's subjective. Now onto the game itself: 

1. I am not very sure if using a third party hosting is a good idea as i'm not sure how secure it would be. However, if there is no money involved during registration and the game is truly free, i guess this isn't much of a critical problem. Have you explored any self-hosting possibility using open source game? 
2. There are multiple variant of poker game if i'm not mistaken, although i'm not thoroughly familiar with all of them, what variant will this poker be?
3. The prize pool definitely need some revision, i'm of the mind that weekly prize should be scaled down a little bit such that it is just enough to hook-in players but the grand finale of the month can remain roughly the same or even scaled up in order to encourage the weekly winners to follow through (aka show-up) until the very end. A high stake also increases anticipation and hype for not only the participants, but also spectators who are not in the game.
4. Need to find out potential abuse that the players can come out with, namely:
-How are you going to make sure the players selection are truly random? Will you drop their name thru some online random generator (and make it live)? What kind of participant is considered  qualified? (i.e: Social media account which is of at least 1 month old?)
-After players are selected, how are you going to make sure that there is no possible *collaboration* among the selected players to rig the game so that everybody will mutually benefit from the outcome of the game?
-How are you going to prevent the same players from participating multiple times under different account?
-Etc, etc?
5. You said the monthly  finale will consist of 4 top players + 2 second placers from weekly game. Am i right to say that there will be a total of 5 games in one month in this order Saturday 1, Saturday 2, Saturday 3, Saturday 4, Sunday 4 (Finale). If that's the case, how are you going to determine which second placers to move on to the finale as there are 8 of them?
6. Should we maybe merge the final week to just one event such that it become Saturday 1, Saturday 2, Saturday 3, and Sunday 4(Finale). Meaning there is only 3 weekly game per month. That way, we can select all first and second placer winners to qualify for the finale for that month which is exactly 6 players. By doing this, we can also cut down one weekly event and thus reducing the prize pool and saving cost.
 

That's all i can think of for now, cheers! If the details and kinks can be worked out satisfactorily, i will definitely support this idea.",aabcfea690ebe8cac3e98c55e8830f31fc70bab77584ac3dffb81918344b2fd6629977ac8210e07192172c38708e1293f59df97b1ae6624cac7613557d72120d,a2f989eabbd68d582510858b6bbf53b6b0be2d981023c21857f885fc947e447c,4,ebb4ee6177796a0e1fea24528b50e89c54e30e023b8db448e8ee4420cb15d954e226cffec242fab48deb1bd538afdbb993b713f0e2d9bae256520a177a9a5c09,1596346987,2,2.0,False,9af99901-60ab-4bff-8080-6eb44f5692e1,gravityz3r0,

Having multiple winners is good for weeklies because it means that more people can win and the prize is more evenly distributed. It is meant for people to feel good because they actually won something no matter how little. We can even expand the winner slots giving consolation prizes to 4th and 5th winner since we have 10 participants.
But when it comes to the monthly final,  i think it has to be substantially different from the usual weekly games. Having more stakes, and a lot harder to win the prize and therefore game is a  more intense and less casual compared to the weekly games.

As for the number,  I'm thinking somewhere along the line of USD1000 (~70DCR) for final and USD500(~35DCR) for weekly pool to begin with.   For example, USD500 can be 250/150/100 or 200/150/100/25/25 if we go to 5th place.

Producing “ghost” works to just display ones ability rarely finds funding in reality. Ie. to illustrate, switch context – would you hire a developer to just code something cool for the sake of the dev being able to demonstrate that he can build stuff?  

Considering there’s no case made on why the work would stand on its own, nor this not being part of any larger initiative, then it’s only an assumption from your side that down the line somebody might pick up the assets and use them part of their work. However this is unlikely to happen, unless there are steps taken to ensure it upfront. 

I don't think its honest to discuss about the price prior to having a clear understanding why something should be produced in the first place and without into specifics of scope, concepts and direction, goals and aims, ones portfolio and expertise etc. Experienced 3D designers certainly work at higher prices than this, but 1.5k to 15k (as a 10x variation) on face value here is an obfuscation when there’s nothing to compare with. There is no CEO of Decred either who will cancel your agreement, and using stakeholders time and tens of thousands of locked up $DCR funds to answer that question isn’t a practical use of the system.

Producing something without a good reason is wasted resource. Try finding common ground with marketing initiatives or other contributors that make proposals – who may benefit from including a designer is a better way of making sure your time is spent towards useful goals.

It is often assumed that a good familiarity with cryptocurrency like Bitcoin/Ethereum is a prerequisite for getting the point of Decred - so maybe a placement in a virtual world like Decentraland (which also has a kind of token governance) or similar would be more interesting than going to the users of these AR apps.

I agree with this sentiment however I think there are some interesting phases that could come before Decentraland and Cryptovoxels which are very very early.

If you haven't checked out https://async.art/ before, this feels far more interesting as a space. 

Programmable and upgradeable art is uniquely enabled by crypto and is far more in keeping with Decred's 'adaptable' nature so there is a natural link to a project capability. 

Example: take a feed of Decred on-chain data and link that to a piece of art. Pablito has [experimented](https://twitter.com/plabarta_/status/1221450735545733122?s=20) in this space already and this feels like an interesting direction with lots of potential... it is however a different idea.

Great to see a Design proposal up on Pi,  especially from the Polish community.   Also congratulations on your recent graduation from PJA.

**A few red flags:**

- There is limited previously produced output. 
- There is no reference to the effectiveness of the output.
- There is a reliance on proprietary 3rd Party Software. 

*Additionally:*

- Cancellation clause, further clarification is required here. 
- Many of the other points worth raising have already been discussed elsewhere.

**Summary:**
Whilst I admire the ambition here I think writing a proposal to ""fund your portfolio"" isn't the way to actually achieve paid work for the project.  In my opinion, a much more effective way of achieving this would be clarifying  ""What does the project actually need?"" and working on a proposal that provides a solution. 

Look forward to the opportunity to vote ""Yes"" on a future proposal, however.

I am not denying their use, but am curious as to what advantages they have over the conventional materials that can be used for promotional purposes, especially given the price point.
I also concur with points made elsewhere that this could work as part of a larger plan, and unless there is one then creating such expensive deliverables to be available ""just in case"" does not sit well with me.

Yes, I am aware of that, but you have to agree that having one's phone out and looking at the word as if it were a huge game of Pokemon GO is just not going to happen anytime soon. I did indeed have a look at the document and example provided within, and as far as paying $1500 per piece I am not impressed, especially since it does not showcase the quality of material that would be delivered to the project.

> Regarding my personal contribution to Decred, I was the original creator of Decred PL twitter but I have handed over the keys while I was busy studying :-)

Yes, I am well aware, but what is your experience in providing deliverables to the project from within the domain that you're trying to apply your skills to? 
Just because one shows initiative in one area does not mean they will automatically gain the support necessary to provide work in area they have not proven themselves to be experienced or capable in, like I doubt anyone would take a marketing contributor seriously if they wanted to start billing for development work without providing acceptable work product first.

Besides that, you mentioned that you and Sylwia were going to be the duo behind this proposal, but as far as the Decred community is concerned she is a complete unknown. This is potentially problematic because, as far as I know,  each contributor needs to have their ability to provide meaningful work assessed individually in order to be issued a contractor clearance. Has she done any work for the project or can you expand on her relationship with Decred?

Moreover, an important point mentioned elsewhere is the cancellation clause. You say that production of new posters can be cancelled at any time, butwithout putting it up for a vote, which makes use of stakeholder attention, there is no way to reliably determine that, which makes me think that although it sounds like an easy way out, the reality of it is much the opposite.

I'm delighted to see a long-term member of the community take initiative in this area. Although I believe your heart to be in the right place with wanting to contribute to Decred in this particular area, I find your proposal to be quite lacking in details for the steep price point of $1500 per piece.

First of all, would you mind explaining how you see these posters contributing to growing the Decred brand and overall awareness? What are the advantages over the conventional Decred-inspired art/graphics?
While I see *some* of the appeal of such art at conferences, unless we all start walking around with AR glasses soon I think this is a very narrow niche that you're seeking to fill, and the novelty factor itself does not appear to justify the expense.

Secondly, you know it is customary for all contributors to provide a kind of proof-of-work and ability to deliver before taking on a proposal-sized task, so could you remind us of your existing contributions to Decred in order to establish your creative track record within the project?

Appreciate seeing more proposals in the design field, however there’s a few major issues. 

Firstly, the why is to ""expand your portfolio"" and ""make something nice"". Neither that or just an act of producing design artifacts for producing them isn't passable reason for funding. Any proposed work needs to be driven by serving and benefiting DCR first and foremost.

15k ask is frankly out of proportion for those reasons and without anything to show. Ie. to put it in perspective, Politeia hackathon at Texas uni had a prize pool of 5k (+ some org costs), with a practical reason of bringing a bunch of fresh dev and use case concepts to the table, as well promoting the project for new grads to get involved with. 

Agree with kozel on AR being too niche and that just a poster would not be practical at a conference. But perhaps that makes for a discussion point to think of creative ways to innovate the DCR's conference presentation and booth game. Its somewhat of a waste imo, that there's a bunch of printed matter produced for confs. in comparison to on screen stuff – where-as Decred is digital in nature. 

My recommendation is to look for common ground with some larger marketing initiative what has practical need for visual comms, and would benefit from working with specific production stack or thinking. And experienced contributors to collaborate with, who are able to provide solid direction and help that ensure whatever is made serves a purpose. Expectation to work off community feedback in a slack channel (don’t even think there is a decred slack any more) won’t bring any good outcome unfortunately. 

And as always with design work in proposals, a portfolio is something expected as that's a way to review ones track record.

thank you for the feedback!

""Make something nice for Decred"" is only simplification. I have just written about it while replying to kozel's comment.

Regarding the steep price I'm afraid I must disagree. Please note that the offer is $1500 for each poster, while the agreement can be cancelled at any time. It means that 15k budget scenario is only possible after 10 months, if all 10 posters will be delivered. Essentially, in case if after the first poster you will say ""we like it, please make another one"" and you will continue to do so 9 times.

I agree that $1500 for just ""a poster"" would be a steep price, but Augmented Reality version is a different thing. It must be either animated, or at least done in 3D to make it interesting. In my personal opinion this price is fair not only in the US, but even here in Poland where I live.

I tried out one of the apps in the sample pdf and to be honest I am not that impressed, it seems like a gimmick to look at these on a phone pointed at a computer screen. I am also not keen on the requirement to download apps to view these posters, and I think this will limit the number of people who see them as they are intended.

I am not impressed with the samples but maybe you plan to produce something better than these, it's hard to envision what quality the posters you produce would be. In any case I don't think there is need for 10 of them at $1,500 each, that seems like a big commitment up front without knowing what to expect.

Considering the audience for these augmented reality posters is probably quite niche, it's worth considering whether that is an audience Decred is particularly relevant for. 

In my view it would be more interesting to situate Decred posters or other artworks within virtual worlds in places where they will be seen by more people, and hopefully people who are receptive to hearing about Decred. It is often assumed that a good familiarity with cryptocurrency like Bitcoin/Ethereum is a prerequisite for getting the point of Decred - so maybe a placement in a virtual world like Decentraland (which also has a kind of token governance) or similar would be more interesting than going to the users of these AR apps.",fa571839f495e639823ac257034a3cfcad536b51650a883e8c53be26654ba3152aa9b34a32a5ba4b4d2d83e7f288bb7efdfc09eea3a62a118df081a498995802,cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e,7,d7bb13f7817177ccacdefd5ce07e4a698cbc8431df7b7ebd6f529bc4a66592962fcaf4856d365b7f140cef960bd149d8cf8029926fe08e34b365901e6d552200,1595105054,1,1.0,False,350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c,richard-red,

AR has exciting applications however the tools to create these posters is fairly ubiquitous (you detail the software needed), so really it's the creative execution that matters and is what makes $1500 / poster either cheap or relatively expensive. 

For the benefit of stakeholders, the market price for a good 3D designer is $300-600 per day, at least that's what we generally work to.  

So splitting the difference, each poster constitutes c.3 days work - is this close to your estimate? I know there are two people so perhaps your rate is lower. 

Once you've created and rendered the layers, the process to turn them into AR is automated through Artvive. I'm assuming you are including the cost of a [subscription](https://artivive.com/pricing/) in your proposal - you don't provide detail as to which package, that would be useful.

Are you are expecting the community to come up with the concepts in the #posters channel that you will then bring to life? 

I think for the price you've quoted it would be good to see an example DCR poster - ideally an original concept, but failing that, one based on an existing DCR poster.

My main concern is that these posters will exist in isolation rather than as part of a more cohesive strategy, where they are just one element within a broader plan. 

I have a thoughts on this so feel free to drop me a [message](https://twitter.com/monsieurbulb), rather than clog up the comments here.

Producing “ghost” works to just display ones ability rarely finds funding in reality. Ie. to illustrate, switch context – would you hire a developer to just code something cool for the sake of the dev being able to demonstrate that he can build stuff?  

Considering there’s no case made on why the work would stand on its own, nor this not being part of any larger initiative, then it’s only an assumption from your side that down the line somebody might pick up the assets and use them part of their work. However this is unlikely to happen, unless there are steps taken to ensure it upfront. 

I don't think its honest to discuss about the price prior to having a clear understanding why something should be produced in the first place and without into specifics of scope, concepts, goals, ones portfolio and expertise etc. Experienced 3D designers certainly work at higher prices than this, but 1.5k to 15k (as a 10x variation) on face value here is an obfuscation when there’s nothing to compare with. There is no CEO of Decred either who will cancel your agreement, and using stakeholders time and tens of thousands of locked up $DCR funds to answer that question isn’t a practical use of the system.

Producing something without a good reason is wasted resource. Try finding common ground with marketing initiatives or other contributors that make proposals – who may benefit from including a designer is a better way of making sure your time is spent towards useful goals.

I agree that this should really be a community-wide initiative. Obviously Politeia doesn't work like that, and you can't call on people not listed in the proposal to do things. However, with enthusiasm building around one of Decred's biggest releases to date (1.6.0), I can only hope the community will assist in promoting any created content.

As I wrote in the proposal, this overlaps with wider marketing efforts to break out of our Decred community bubble. I am excited and supportive of the on-going talks and new ideas creative community members are generating.

As for giving away DCR for pushing out the message, I am generally skeptical because it has a high risk of building the wrong kind of relationship.

I understand the treasury usually works as back-payments, but for marketing expenses, it's very difficult to front these. I think this is the reason why marketing hasn't really been done for Decred in a sustainable manner. 

In regards to non-trivial risk from paid promotions, I will ensure that the content is educational content intended to increase awareness of the project. With no claims to $USD gains, or any other financial advice. It will be promoting the features of Decred, rather than a investment pitch.

> There's a risk that this kind approach could damage the positive aspects of Decred's reputation with poorly chosen ""shout-out partners"" or copy for ads, so I would be more comfortable if it was being driven by people who have a more established track record in the community.

In regards to that, the idea here is helping Decred go viral by paying small amounts for retweets. A good concept is, taking existing pro-DCR tweets, and having people outside of the DCR community retweet it, for the word to reach their respective audiences outside of the DCR community. This strategy would be employed to promote educational DCR content, rather than blatant shilling which doesn't look good. Using social media, not just Twitter, to help increase awareness and educate the greater crypto community.

> For the costs associated with these promotional activities, I saw a comment in the Discord channel which suggested you might be able to cover these up-front and claim it back from the Treasury? That kind of detail would be good to include in the proposal.

This was originally an idea, it may also be. But it's important for me to test the politea system, and how community governance works. The vision I have for Decred is being a DAO, where people with best interests come forward and contribute to the community. The way I am doing this is, I've introduced myself to the community for a while. Became a stakeholder, now I created a Marketing Workgroup with some community members, and these funds will act as a pool for our workgroup to execute tasks. 

It doesn't look quite as attractive if I needed to front the funding, and then bill treasury. This way of request feels more organic of a movement.",80a0c85fe593cfbb185a79baff1551fd91b0bd8f32804dd800acab9a388c09366fbad81723430293603c00bd24d0b119a53176fc8e3a291940d3f337fc237a03,32897bbb15aecbb302093b61a5b037f86e2c5f73a1b9268009edcd331d958e29,3,f08075d9c1ce7f5d4f8e703bdaffb8a2ceba48d724f3d83960444022a49341f6c026b1e980a6204dad49864a3934089ab22c67fdbd26ecced8a6963c36c88b0e,1596206472,0,,False,84ed7a25-4aa1-4cb4-a70e-8b5f98deb068,fst_nml,

> What is the strategy of these tweets and retweets? How many cost twitter paid ads and what is the strategy? Maybe that with the workgroup you can discuss and research to bring all the details.

The strategy for the tweets and retweets is allocating a fraction of the funds to incentivize retweets of DCR content, or create new content. One opportunity which also exists is creating a tweet which well defines the ethos of the @decredproject and pinning and promoting that as a paid ad. For example:

Decred - Secure, adaptable, sustainable
21 million
Fair distribution
Built in staking rewards
Privacy
Rockstar developers

Like Retweet 
Promoted

Something similar to that, is just an example. 

> We already have very good videos from Exitus, but even if you still want to make others, I would like to see a description similar to his proposal, what content will you prepare, how many hours recording, how many hours to edition, how many videos, when you deliver this content.

Exitus has great videos, but they aren't being advertised afaik. I will provide the example of the main way I want to use the videos. It's creating multiple 10 second videos, such as ""Decred offers 6% interest through the staking mechanism. Swipe up to learn more"", ""Tired of politicians playing games with your money? Decred has a politea voting system to bring back voting with your money"" ""Tired of paying high BTC transaction fees? Use Decred's network for a faster crypto experience!"" (These are all just examples)

Then, we can run paid ad campaigns on things like Snapchat, and other social media, targetted to informing the world and these non-crypto users about Decred. Out of all the methods, this one I think has the potential to generate the best return. Snapchat ad campaigns have been proven very effective for generating new interest for financial related projects. 

The main goal here would be to bring new users and new interest to Decred. They start buying and staking. 

> What kind of materials, what the value you will ask in these platforms?

Similar to whats described above, media content, and promoting that said media content.

> Isn't this PR's job? If not, what would be your focus, any specific blog/site, what is the amount to be spent on each one?

It could be, but I have not interacted with him yet. But I have a guy who publishes press releases on top sites like Forbes, Business, etc. It could also be a good idea for these funds to be spent here.

> There is so much work here, maybe you must bill for that and get some help.

No, I don't want to bill for myself. This funding will pay for the expenses that managing and running this campaign will incur. 

I intend to use the $10k for 3 things mainly. 

Twitter retweets, social media virality.

The message needs to be well defined to ensure it maintains Decred brand ethos. What I would personally prefer to see is further definition on what exactly is planned for delivery. Who are the influencers being targeted? What are examples of the content to be disseminated and who is the target audience?

I believe it is important that stakeholders continue to maintain Treasury protocol of de-risking as much as possible by getting a well established plan of what will be delivered and the message that is being sent. This is not to say I don't assume you have the best interests of the project at heart, it is because we will have an increasing volume of proposals as the project grows and all must stand up to the same benchmark test.

1. I don't think it's any good practice to propose for work without an assembled team who will be involved in actual work. Especially when there is no prior track-record of contributions. Hiring creatives from crowdwork sites like fiverr and upwork is a dodgy approach, unlikely to bring decent results, due to both subcontracting low or entry skill level production/writing/design people, as well them having likely having no or little understanding on DCR and blockchain in general. Someone with a superficial understanding of what they work on is unlikely to do their best work. A better way would be finding the actual people first upfront and getting them well onboarded on what's what already, as this is no trivial task.

2. It's worth looking into and learning about what's been made in the past in terms of paid ads, .ie beanstalk stuff? Iirc these were dropped altogether during sm cryptobans in 2018. Not sure how many results they brought before that. I'm personally on the opinion that most forms of paid ads are not particularly effective, [and come off like this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/470/033/88a.jpg). Specifically, banners and all kinds of in-between ""blocks"" on sm are an utter nuisance.

As an overall response to the comments, we kindly ask community members to consider the following facts, and answer for the future of the project the question we pose:

- **Fact 1:** Decred is direct competitor of Bitcoin.
- **Fact 2: **Decred has many technical advantages compared to Bitcoin. But Bitcoin has much wider recognition and market share.
- **Fact 3:** Decred's advantages over Bitcoin are not visible on the Internet and the word of mouth for Decred (Galaxy Score of 61 on LunarCrush) is certainly worse than that for Bitcoin (Galaxy Score of 75 on LunarCrush)
- **Fact 4:** There are tens of thousands of memes on Bitcoin (https://tinyurl.com/bitcoinmemesongoogle) compared to just a few memes for Decred (https://preview.tinyurl.com/decredmemesongoogle)
- **Fact 5:** Most of the memes on Decred are of very poor visual quality and some are even negative (https://preview.tinyurl.com/negativememeaboutdecred)
- **Fact 6: **The Decred community has obviously not come up with high quality memes that are indexed by Google, until now.
- **Fact 7: **Decred is continuously losing value against Bitcoin. Please click ""ALL"" under https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/DCRBTC/?exchange=BINANCE
- **Fact 8: **Decred, *if the current rate of value loss continues*, is under the risk of becoming a ""dead coin"", which would cause all the investment of community members (including ours) to go to zero. 
- **Fact 9:** Marketing with memes would definitely *not* be harmful to Decred project. It *may* add value if the created high quality memes are virally shared by the community at large.
- **Fact 10:** The financial aspects of the proposal can be assessed not only through opinions or perceptions, but also in comparison to rates for similar services and the value to be added in comparison to the cost.
- **Question:** Given the current continuing declining situation of Decred against Bitcoin, which is better? 

- To **support** a proposal which aims to initiate a change at a minimal cost, and use their high quality memes as a stepping stone for extensive Internet marketing by community? 
- Or to **block** the low-cost proposal, forwarding the proposing team to other crypto communities, then wait for Decred community to create high quality memes on their own (which did not happen until now), and in the meantime watch **Decred losing more value and risking deeper to becoming a ""dead coin""** (http://deadcoins.com), while **200 Decred out of 21,000,000 DCR are preserved**.",40ac7fe6e71cc058fde327301fa4223dcd10278c27f21968768c2d687bcd9ef7a84751ab5cb591b98c031a780aed29e61b6e7cda77400be9b9641e5c92f7e00a,7e387b3ad0628756f22cb380e37acb9b76bca50b300bb297493a50afb728dfc4,15,b1a15df012ec6ecf259dd9ab6271ed74b80f7d8a961171211e1425234bcde5eff5181943f3dc3cc1bf580258609ceb8db3aca278c393566e53b452228ffcc10a,1596542744,0,,False,7602425c-d221-4154-aeb8-a7ddd2fa4649,cryptoarchitect,

2. Yes, we do believe that Decred *may* and most likely *will* be doomed if effective marketing is not executed. Memes are part of marketing, even though only a small part and we hope that our proposal will contribute.
3.  Highlighting the importance of memes is not fear mongering. It is a statement of a psychological phenomena. 
4. **Humans warm to accepting ideas, products, people, and systems through memes.** This has been seen countless time historically. 
5. The memes can be quotes (maybe technical), logos, images, videos, or combinations. 
6. **Every single popular product, person, ideology, anything with a network effect is built on a meme, or more frequently, a series of memes. **
7. This is currently lacking with respect to Decred and we are proposing a solution to this simple yet important topic. How we wish there was not such a gap and that we could develop other content, which we are certainly capable of. However, we believe this has much higher priority and a low hanging fruit, with high potential impact.
8. What we do see as fear mongering, at least for us, has been the decline of value of Decred against Bitcoin, against which we are proposing to do something at a super reasonable cost.
9. Even more fear mongering thing for us has been the fact that some community members (exitus, in specific) state negative sentiment against our proposal, for example saying that it is too expensive at $15/image, which is $30/hour, when they themselves have approved projects of their own (https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/95cfb73) where they are receiving $30/hour. It is fear mongering to see such biased attack on new proposals by those who already are receiving the community's money for their own projects.
10. We still believe that **strong high quality memes can contribute greatly to the marketing of Decred** if accompanied with widespread use of those memes. We are looking forward to the vote of community.",3f57b5ae60e7631583285c44d7ea1b0bb96649e3cc24243d768b9808b9993bfee748699445e3b195ef1cd9eb4a000e2ddb5d195fdb047bdb69c5a24225e4fe08,7e387b3ad0628756f22cb380e37acb9b76bca50b300bb297493a50afb728dfc4,18,b14082488a5c8916a45f35000e65e7c0cd447e99f9f0555afa9725a118181e9d657873038d911772a188533e341dd362406a65093e41909741934f638a3bed08,1596640076,0,,False,7602425c-d221-4154-aeb8-a7ddd2fa4649,cryptoarchitect,

First I wanted to say that I think memes are an important part of modern internet culture and have a larger influence than most people would think, and I would love to see more Decred themed memes. 

It has been speculated that Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election because he had ""meme magic"" on his side. Chainlink's community pumped out more memes than any other and they've managed to get into the top 10. Dogecoin, a literal meme coin, is valued at ~$400,000,000 with no active development. There are more examples, but you get the point.

With that said, I think paying people to make memes is a bad idea that would negatively affect organic community involvement. Anyone can open up Photoshop, MS Paint, Gimp etc and throw some text over a picture to create a meme. Looking at your portfolio, I'm not seeing anything special that would warrant ~$150 per meme. Take this one for instance: https://imgur.com/a/xh3uPMD and compare it to something more high-end like this from Chainlink: https://imgur.com/a/oISom6s

On top of that, we already have amazing designers from Eeter working as contractors.

The take on memes in the proposal is somewhat superficial. Production of simple humorous puns in combination with some visuals is sort of a lower tier meme for a lack of better terminology. I'm on the opinion, these do not typically come across well when produced as a paid effort as well may create conflicts with the author, due to being highly subjective – but rather work when made out of love and interest.

In terms of memetics, as in really getting traction of an idea or some piece of information to a degree of it producing a noticeably viral spread, there’s unfortunately very few who pull off top tier memetic engineering at a consistent rate. The domain is highly experimental. I’m on the opinion that unless you’ve got a track record of producing stuff that’s gone properly viral in past, or is really appreciated by the community – I would not support funding it. 

On paid memetics work, there's an older trend with ad/marketing agencies of trying to sell viral marketing campaigns to get a piece of that pie. Though the same issues applies – very few can  pull off something impactful. I recon this boils down to both factors of luck as mentioned, as well having the talent that's knowledgable and observant enough, combined with the thinking abilities to produce the potent enough thing that doesn't come off fake and whatnot. Noticeably the types who do that are rarely your average marketing or advertising people, but rather artists and eccentric types.

In DCR's past, I believe [jackliv3r](https://cryptograffiti.com/) has been the only contributor who's been funded (probably minimally?) for work that could count as memes, after he produced some quite catchy graphic pieces that at the time really caught on and received a lot of support, as well [cryptograffiti](https://cryptograffiti.com/) – though not sure if he was even funded?

I could see funding memetics make sense if its someone/group with both a real track record of producing impactful and viral stuff (regardless of the format), with an in-depth understanding and alignment of the project fundamentals (and/or a large following or access to channels that also would support outcomes).

1. Yes, each design costs 10 Decred, but is it too much?
2. Each design is produced in 10 different dimensions. 
3. This means that community members will have a design for their preferred Social media platform, with the dimensions of the image specific for that platform. 
4. Quality over quantity. 
5. So, each image costs 1 decred, which is 15 usd. 
6. We challenge any community member to come up with an alternative graphic design provider, person or company, with each image costing $15 and images having such high quality.

Thank you for sharing your opinions on our proposal.  Here are some facts and our opinions on the matter:

1. Fact: Decred is direct competitor of Bitcoin.
2. Fact: Decred has many technical advantages compared to Bitcoin.
3. Fact: Decred's advantages over Bitcoin are not visible on the Internet and the word of mouth for Decred (Galaxy Score of 61 on LunarCrush) is certainly worse than that for Bitcoin (Galaxy Score of 75 on LunarCrush)
4. Fact: There are tens of thousands of memes on Bitcoin (https://tinyurl.com/bitcoinmemesongoogle) compared to just a few memes for Decred (https://preview.tinyurl.com/decredmemesongoogle)
5. Fact: Most of the memes on Decred are of very poor visual quality and some are even negative (https://preview.tinyurl.com/negativememeaboutdecred)
6. Fact: The Decred community has obviously not come up with high quality memes that are indexed by Google, until now.
7. Fact: Decred is continuously losing value against Bitcoin. Please click ""ALL"" under https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/DCRBTC/?exchange=BINANCE 
8. Fact: Marketing with memes would definitely not be harmful to Decred project.
9. Fact: When a person is voting for this project, a question that can be asked is this: For a 300 million USD project (Decred), is 3000 USD marketing budget too much, or in other words is the contribution of this proposal going to be less than what it asks for. 
10. Opinion: The existing Memes on the Internet are not even comparable quality wise to do memes that our team has designed.
11. Opinion: We challenge any community member to come up with an alternative graphic design provider, person or company, with each image costing $15 and images having such high quality.
12. Opinion: We believe that it is much better to have standard super high quality memes that can be systematically used by community members, rather than expecting to come up with Memes on their own (which so far did not seem to happen). 
13. Opinion: The next bull market for cryptocurrencies is already here and this is Decred’s last chance to break years of silence and stalled price. An investment in super high quality memes, accompanies with a dedicated “army” of volunteers to spread these memes, can make a big difference for the future of the community and the project.

*On top of that, we already have amazing designers from Eeter working as contractors. At the very least I would suggest for you to create some Decred memes voluntarily to show what you would potentially deliver, though I doubt the community would fund something like this given the recent uptick in Decred themed art showing up on twitter from long time Decred fans.*

- Our previous work and the proposal & our replies are clear proof of our professionalism and quality of work. 
- We are not planning on creating ""voluntary"" memes for Decred. Everyone in crypto world wants to earn money, and nobody can be asked to work for free. 
- Our proposal is not a proposal to work for free, but to offer our high quality services to this community for a super low price.
- We believe this is a biased comment, and we even suspect a conflict of interest, given that Eeter is mentioned but the relation of exitus to Eeter is not mentioned.
- exitus is mentioining $150 per design ($15 per image, $30/hour as too much.  Given that you have mentioned Eeter working as contractor, could you also please share their cost per hour? 
- Please also can you share the free work that Eeter has provided in the recent past? So that we know if providing free work is a standard expectation in the Decred community or is it an expectation of exitus.
- Given the costs, the community can make decision for their own whether $150 is too much for the high quality memes we are proposing.",f078585d259519f6c4cfc7b91fa9bb2835f28dcfeab411d7b89a46678debbfcb705576364f903937100a75838abfa710ebe3f18dc0df1ead68e2b43446983f09,7e387b3ad0628756f22cb380e37acb9b76bca50b300bb297493a50afb728dfc4,9,be78529bce8566643ce29770ca04f4360c69a71ce2499a446c4cbff8765247c8407ae6abcdefb58c91a4cb76d7cf433d8ec56340cf6dee30288e4a2009f6ab00,1596531624,0,,False,7602425c-d221-4154-aeb8-a7ddd2fa4649,cryptoarchitect,

The ways to publish design outputs that I see now are uploading them as attachments to GitHub issues and releases. Other ways are to publish them on YouTube, Behance, Notion, Adope, LottieFiles, Sketch, etc. All these are proprietary platforms that host our files and offer no way to get them all at once and update incrementally. This is very different from source code produced by the development domain, where I can periodically update a dozen of Git repositories and get a full copy of everything. Even if we face any issues with GitHub, the Git repos could be re-hosted elsewhere. And the fact that full repositories are stored and synced by dozens of people makes this data very resilient. In case of design, all that is currently stored in Git is the README file.

My concern is that should anything happen to GitHub or the other platforms, community's access to design files will be interrupted.

To be fair, Git is not the best tool to store large binary files but I think it could handle repos below ~1 GB and work as an intermediate solution. For storing more data we can explore other tools, but even the good old file server with rsync would be more resilient than GitHub attachments.

Background: I'm a minimalist type and prefer software that does the job without too much fancy stuff. Abstracting from its weak architecture for a second, Electrum wallet is a good example of that, UI-wise: basic ""boring"" widgets, no animations/shadows/blur/advanced fonts/etc and it does the job to send/receive funds, manage keys, and such. Because of this preference I'm not a fan of Decrediton and I'm ok with command line, but I admit it is not the most productive UX to deal with.

I realize that command-line UIs is not an option for most users if we talk about the broad adoption we all want. But I have no idea for how many people it is important to have not just ""boring"" basic gray GUI like Electrum, but a ""rich UI"" like Decrediton.

So my first question is, is this rich design driven by demand? How many people prefer it over the minimalist style? Is it safe to assume that my type is the minority? :) And for example, how do you make desisions like adding dark mode to Politeia?

Next thing, I do love beauitful UIs myself, but only when it doesn't come at the cost of two important aspects - security and resources.

The first is a tradeoff between rich visuals and security of software. Implementing rich design requires adding more code and dependencies. Not a big issue for a weather app, but extra code and dependencies that have not been audited for handling serious stuff like money is my main concern about rich design in crypto software.

Second is resources. Rich complex designs consume more storage, memory, and battery. I'd love Decred software to run on decade old devices since they are easier to debloat and secure. And they are cheap, which is good for decentralization.

Could you please comment on how design domain is taking these concerns into account?",7bc62aeb5a76e070dfca088d20cb2e1f28e2548cc85c69c43c9f85338bdcdf98bae7fcbab0fa76fa53376d3b73dba6531525ba7df68ce6285989f05dff7a4104,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,13,ffd5886aed0f4f0ed6fe3cd26c854efda6cc71ca56915c55bb1681175d9c7e25638d7064837a74bbf2dd38219f39997b3b416301bdd173fb9dafb90d2da79607,1597882356,2,2.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

Electrum has a minimal GUI in a sense of using base windows components iirc and being bare-bones in using them only to get the functionality done. Decrediton has its custom UI components, with its own rationale to best support the functionality and usability. 

Now the components are just the artifacts from a visual design stage, which can be richer or simpler in visual terms based what makes sense. Either can make sense, and either has pro's / con's. But whether one or other makes for a good UX is a much broader topic. So for example I could make a case for electrum’s UI having an inadequate use of space in some areas, and too many details, causing complexity in a different area. Comes down to a number of fundamentals that make up the rendering of different intentions.

Another consideration of the visual side is the psychological share. Just talking about the visual outlook of the app matters a fair bit when applied to broader and more mainstream use. If one's funds are on the line, the first impression of something looking potentially ""dodgy"" or just crude will more likely make the person question using it, if not alienate.

To put the various cases on a chart: i'd say command-line software is obviously for the most technical users and developers; something that's bare-bones function-oriented GUI, with little finesse on the usability side is perfectly fine for early adaptors, testers and tech savy users; whereas a more refined UI is most appropriate for broader mainstream use, ie. being on-bar with common practices and standards of everyday banking UI's, etc as well taking the effort to onboard and educate the users on concepts that are novel to crypto space. 

To answer the questions:

1. The “rich” design as described is for making it the product more accessible and appropriate for a broader user base.  

2. Decisions on bigger changes and features generally happen on demand and over collaboration. I believe dark mode is pretty popular amongst developers and has solid reasoning otherwise. As you know anyone can suggest ideas to improve things and ultimately we do only work on things that get traction and are picked up by the developers.

3. Security: It's pretty well rooted amongst the dcr designers that we don’t create things that have 3rd party requirements, or typically it's consulted with the devs if a security concern is found. Ie. no comfy features like fiat price tracking in decrediton.

4. Resources/efficiency: I do myself appreciate the similar goals on a personal level and find it a noble pursuit to go after efficiency where possible. Though there's a fine line where things get too robust and compromise the usability too much … or you know become more appropriate for a niche rather than broader use. So a matter of balance. The GUI's visual design is what it is on each release and does change (hopefully for the better) with each new release. I do think we've matured things over time as the project itself matures, ie. on the identity and visual comms side you can see much more geometric and conceptual pieces in opposed to more colorful characters and illustrations, but also the same applies with more nuance in the GUI's, ie. pi-ui, finessing and dialing down for the GUI to be more invisible, like a good book design what doesn't take away attention from reading.",cd8a309c9837a05d7003fbe802f6b6ec8b4ebe6995580651a331a035a5cb19a2f26e955b3efdd4cb958e54a9251d4b6d94731ffe2e889938141389fc17638704,3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859,14,7440b0afb9b6a534b1724e33c8799ba977917ce4b902b2bb48af37b6fc8e5e9b392cc5e82f960d1f4393b528d4cd4bb0b41f9d5ca301740c22d6938b01e81606,1598023278,2,2.0,False,ba96e181-abff-4c1a-b2be-9bb916ea4083,linnutee,

Though I do think if there's a noticeable increase in users – it would make a solid project on its own to establish a feedback collection and archiving system. I would make the case that it should actually be separate from the product repo's if done on a bigger scale.

At the current state it would need quite a lot of manual work to essentially work out a back-up system of everything (including commentary on things) on a regular basis. I'd say the most realistic case is getting releases on /dcrdesign to be more periodic, and looking to future aim to reduce the need of different platforms where it makes sense.

Re: Politeia Digest images, at some point around issue #10 it was suggested I should ask for title images. I received several sets of renders to use for the title image of each issue, which I was very happy with. I think I received 15-16 such images. 

For the shorter issues, I started wondering whether it was worth using a whole fresh new render, because these issues are quite cheap to produce the cost of the title render may end up being a significant portion of the whole cost. So, I started to re-use some of the older renders by swapping out the dates.

I don't know how much each render for Politeia Digest costs exactly. I would like to get some more produced but I don't know how much it makes sense to spend on these. Pi digest has a budget which is ~20% of the Journal, so maybe it makes sense to split the budget for Journal/Digest images in this proposal (3,500 for 6 months) in roughly the same way. I don't know, and I'm pretty flexible. The next steps would seem to be decide how many images Pi digest will get in this 6 months and then produce the blank templates at your (or sænder's) leisure, and I can add them into the rotation.",95c386ed2c9f1bcd4b1ec177b9ec91c8b95815e908ff4f529a1a4f12881b76635e145fbdbe66b054174442b9f53c48cbc540aac91d97cd580c01939ff9cb9703,cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e,20,b83aa5d7e47fcd816afed8d140ec3f76bdcc6511f10cff7c106bd8390e49143ed4de1c0eed10095c49dbc41c74eec5763c231eba8b340bc47d1da2b22bb7680f,1598101107,2,2.0,False,350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c,richard-red,

These small details add up and contribute to an overall impression about the project.

Re security, I referred to code and library dependencies rather than 3rd party network requests (which should be used with great care too, obviously). For example, I'm not sure which number of Decrediton [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/network/dependencies) should I use (116, 126 or 1,361 (omg)), but in any case it is quite a lot and a pretty large surface for possible security issues. To be fair, devs would know better how many of them had to be added to implement the rich design.

I find this proposal to be reasonable, but I will also provide broader feedback about the design domains accomplishments here as well as information for the decred community on actions that can to be taken. Work from morphymore on the mobile wallets with material design has been quite polished. There has been strong coordination between him and the mobile wallets teams. I was surprised to see mobile listed under the design budget without any prior notice from linnutee, as there has been no known discussion or involvement from linnutee on mobile since morphymore was referred to begin working with the the mobile wallet team. An overarching theme I continue to see is a lack of connection between the design domain and the technology teams.

There have been multiple iterations of videos produced for Decred, both of which are produced with high quality visuals and branding, but strongly lacking in technical explanation. My concern is this type of branding facade which is disconnected from the technology doesn't distinguish Decred from the large sea of other crypto projects which are also easily able to dump money into style and branding. Other crypto projects do not have the strong technical foundations which distinguish us from the crowd. I had started work on solving this problem some time ago and produced a short video on a small budget called How Decred is Unique. The effort was criticized for taking initiative without clearly alerting the design team leads, and subsequent efforts to improve upon the video were met with a lack of availability from the design team. To this day, the How Decred is Unique video is often reused in clips by the public because its a video that actually talks about and illustrates how Decred works. The result this leaves us with today, is the original How Decred is Unique video continues to be syndicated in its original form without being updated. It leaves us with a void in high quality explainer videos which are informative as well as captivating. This dramatically weakens us in an area that is a primary avenue for people on the internet to learn about Decred. It is notable that Exitus has come along and has been creating high quality bi-weekly videos on current events. His work has been the biggest strength added to Decred on the video front.

A large focus of this proposal is UI/UX, but it does not appear there are strong feedback loops with users or that any measurements are being taken in regards to effectiveness. My team was able to gather user experience feedback from working with local crypto meetup groups to observe the onboarding process for Decrediton users. What we found was that >50% of non-technical users attempting to get into staking with Decrediton ended up abandoning the process within 6 weeks due to not being able to get through the complicated setup process without encountering errors, or unsolvable errors related to staking happening after completing the setup process. We then looked at the complication in the user experience and determined that much of the registration process causing errors for users with stakepools was unnecessary. We were able to map out a new streamlined process for users which switched from a user based authentication to ticket based authentication. Certainly this required technical understanding to solve, but it was from understanding the failure points in the user experience that the problem was identified. This is distinct from contributions in style and branding.

One of the tools that would be most useful to the Decred community right now is print materials that they can download, take to their local print shop, and create a stack of post cards to distribute to their local communities. I would think this would fall in the design domain, but there is also a lack of coordination with a copy writing domain to create the content. https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/149  There exists some print materials with good style and branding, but the information is confusing, and it doesn't provide the information users need to get them converted and on-boarded to Decred.

The website has the same issue.

Thought I’d chip in here as it kind of brushes on a subdomain I work within.

It’s worth making the distinction at this point that both Decred’s current explainer and the “How is Decred Unique” video are good for the reason that they communicate points in an appropriate way for their respective target audiences.   I’ll leave this here as there are no explainer video components as a part of this proposal.

> The effort was criticized for taking initiative without clearly alerting the design team leads, and subsequent efforts to improve upon the video were met with a lack of availability from the design team.

This statement above is misleading.

I met with yourself and Justin Santoro following the creation of “How is Decred Unique” on your request to offer technical support to Justin and assist in the creation of further pieces.   I did at no point withdraw my support for Justin’s ambitions to create content, in fact it was very much the opposite as there were quite a few instances where we worked together on elements for his pieces.

Some months later I was informed by Justin that he was moving on from working on video pieces to work on becoming a Developer.  I haven’t heard much since but I hope he’s keeping well. 

There will always be instances where designers disagree with developers and vice versa however I firmly believe that encouraging this “Us vs. Them” rhetoric is wholly unhelpful and built upon (in some cases) paper-thin foundations as exemplified by the instance above.

Mobile wallet: Glad you’re happy with Morphy’s work and his collaboration. This proposal provides open budgets for all designers to work on what they do, and the contributions within the domain regardless of the product are useful for all. As he works autonomously with you guys and was fine with it just as everyone else, I don’t see any need for myself to get further involved or manage things with you – as this isn’t the case for other products either. If your goal is to have all the product work expenditure maintained in a single proposal in opposed to the general domain one - then please do so.


> The effort was criticized for taking initiative without clearly alerting the design team leads, and subsequent efforts to improve upon the video were met with a lack of availability from the design team.

The critique on your explainer animation was regarding the logic errors and poor ways in visualization of these technical details. This was coming from other developers. A technically accurate, infographic type explainer can’t lack in that area. In comparison, the two other explainers are illustrative in nature, and use metaphors to communicate higher level ideas and fundamentals. Either approach is fine if done well and has its use.

The root of the problem here is with yourself tasking a recent film grad (at the time), who’s skill set was for a completely different medium, and throwing him on a task well beyond his ability. It’s no trivial task to produce a solid explainer animation! To keep things realistic, I was clear to everyone involved in that channel, including Justin, what are the specific competencies needed to produce one and what was lacking. Given that Justin was genuinely still interested in producing something, I and Kyle provided him reasonable support and suggested a realistic approach in the form of a simpler version by recycling already created graphic and motion assets. Never did we agree to just pick up and do the whole thing. Logged here: https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/32

It's an absurd notion to give, that someone should just pick up anothers failed delivery, drop their own work and get it sorted.


> We were able to map out a new streamlined process for users which switched from a user based authentication to ticket based authentication.

The staking infrastructure is a development fundamental, thus going beyond my domain expertise. Given the way Decreds being built, designers work on improving the UX around the currently existing infrastructure and what’s possible within these dev limitations. Whether the interactions involved, UI used, tutorials and Stakey etc to add up. Staking UX isn't something mainstream and doesn't have a best practice to look at, but rather we invent novel approaches around the structure that's been built. Things can always be better, but I'll refer to a historic average of >50% of the DCR being staked, so that doesn’t tell me it’s as bad your trial groups data.

> I would think this would fall in the design domain, but there is also a lack of coordination with a copy writing domain to create the content

Not really. But there's not any specific writing domain or operations either afaik, besides perhaps the work on docs and as well the PR stuff around marketing. Technical writing, PR writing and creative and UX copywriting are all completely different animals. More sub parts if you take in translating. Historically Decred's had a serious lack of creative copywriting expertise (ie. explainer narratives) and that's been covered as a group efforts. Agree with bee's suggestion below.

> An overarching theme I continue to see is a lack of connection between the design domain and the technology teams.

These loaded notions rather alienate people, and I don't see any better example set from your end. I don’t see any of that staking research being shared in the public for discussions or suggestions made to work on. I’ve made efforts to push the design domain to be open and accessible, root quality and provide support to all of the key products, including dcrandroid and dcrdata which you run your own way. The two have been historically in a bad shape regarding design, and if anything there’s little responsiveness and interest to collaborate shown from your side, ie. https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/181 are not the only efforts that didn’t even get a response.",77510e81dd8fd84978332a2efff12413fb4cf664a61adbee567e6462da0bca78683f652ef4f2671d3f66c15bfd3e645aa9af287020ed73243a146bf13bbca003,3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859,31,1fd492a4c2c17e0ea18fbac1d361cbdcaa8d010cd2cd31616c9fb0c291528fa27d858bd58385e538a92b1dc2d14d3f689b3bdca5aa79bdad79358a2a117a2504,1598367437,0,,False,ba96e181-abff-4c1a-b2be-9bb916ea4083,linnutee,

These sets are based on a single larger (or more complex composition), which is modelled with the intent to be rendered at various crops and angles to produce a set of different images and get as much quantity out of it as possible.

I get what you mean regarding the toolbox. We’ve given some thought on the matter a while back about taking the accessibility of the brand resources to a next level so to say. Ideally i’d see this in a form of a site that functions as a both very accessible resource center + docs in one. The accessibility side is kind of the easier part, as there’s bunch of clever things do streamline finding the right resources, ie. say someone looks for a dcr logo to print on a shirt -> clarify these parameters in simple search -> link to appropriate CMYK file, rather than the full package to search through.

1.2K Yes votes as of writing indicates that the idea has something to it, but also something is not right (structure or size of the offer, market conditions, etc).

I think promotion is the best part of the idea, assuming it would have the right ""Decred vibe"" in it and you have large enough audience. I wish it was possible to test this in small scale to see if it makes any impact for DCR to build stakeholders' confidence in offers like this. We still feel sad after burning a ton of money on marketing without getting good results, so it is no surprise that stakeholders are skeptical about this and other recent marketing proposals.

Another issue is that DCR does not seem to be at the level of adoption where it could show significant volumes on such platforms. The overall idea is interesting.

Seems I must not have explained the campaign well enough if your take away is 5 articles. Let me break this down a bit.

With what I am going to call a version One Partnership -
Let's start with what has happened to projects who work with us - Notably would be NEM's who increased their market cap 20% on the announcement and most recently SWIPE with a huge rally to their native token.
Now, that was just the announcement. We continue to provide value with regular reports on how the token is being used when we partner with more mainstream travel brands and their communities. 

Here is the difference in what I am going to call a version Two partnership - (What is above)
We plan for the opportunity to attract new users to DCR, and boost engagement of existing holders. (Ultimately what I think your marketing goals would be?)
- Whitelabel version of the DCR site 
- 12 months or targeting advertising (That is user-based not location-based so we get the message in front of the right people)
-  Some launch activity to activate the base and give them collateral to share around
- A long term partnership to ensure that future travel industry partnerships do benefit both of us 
- Regular reporting of usage of the currency proving the use case (putting money where your mouth is so to speak) - The best kind of PR is doing!
- A discounted rate for listing ( Which I am against as it reduces the barrier to entry for projects, the higher the better as it shrinks the community that can get involved increasing the value of the opportunity. If everyone could afford a Ferrari they wouldn't be cool) just $15K to play instead of the standard $50K. 


Maybe I am still off base, so let me talk about my credentials for a second. I have doubled the sales of global travel businesses around the world and helped grow several startups to million-dollar evaluations in under 6months  through marketing, advertising, product and PR. If you still dont see the point, Cool.",eb0bc51099668dd7bfe8ed9eecb1bdd8d8b3a666f5642dd0c8cf90cd5c43e1a0065c17f3e37b5e170d7de7d04ec1b06db88273b687524ebcecc10666d86db802,7805f6391bd83260aa5009c143fdf0eea1d44266bb5b5de25ed51e830fbbe29e,4,d5876d6732906192deff6ffb06197d61ab1e36fd9f9340840c1062cc4a635cf6288ec8bc43da95a4e93dbff3e0662b7aeb9384d70a182d57499f8d3beb2a5600,1596160162,0,1.0,False,bc745ec4-4c2b-4b64-8e20-6a2d6d97a3de,travelwithben,1.0

Thanks. This is the first time I'm going through the proposal process and I begin to appreciate (even more) all the leadership/coordination work being done across various teams. It takes quite some time to figure out all the details with the all people involved, plan, answer questions, etc.

I agree that overall the situation is not out of control right now but let me add some details.

> the decred community size has not reach the critical point where a proper and paid moderation is warranted just yet

Please note that all work described in the proposal is _already_ happening at the _current_ size of the community (see the ""expected"" figures), plus I added some room for growth (the ""limit"" figures), but that will not be used if not necessary.

> From what i can see, there has been no serious ""out-of-control"" FUD or troll that's plaguing these channel so far

This is exactly what you should observe if moderators are doing their jobs.

I can mention some examples from Reddit since I moderate it for 2 years now.

We had a few cases where small groups of randos showed up out of nowhere and FUDded about certain aspects of the project, only to stop engaging and disappear forever after a day or two. Sometimes I posted ""moderator's analysis"" like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/96j9ai/transparency_in_payments_made_with_the_community/e41vaut/) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8hlhtf/considering_the_lack_of_talent_and_the_8_million/dz5npgy/) in the same thread to warn other users.

The most interesting Reddit incident so far was the ""spam ring"" I identified in 2018 where ~40 users posted innocent-looking (sometimes even reasonable) comments that likely have been generated from various articles on the web. Interestingly, they were not strictly anti or pro Decred, and posted a mixture of positive, negative, neutral statements and even questions. It was around 100 comments spanning 40 threads. I don't know what was the goal of their master, but I can imagine that it could be used to control the narrative. I reproted the ""gang"" to Reddit and didn't see anything of that scale since then.

> Another risk is to lose volunteers that do some jobs without asking for money e.g. someone who is a volunteer with technical support will stop or decrease the help if someone is paid to dedicate themselves to it.

Two issues here so let's break it down.

Regarding technical support (1), please mind that this proposal focuses on moderation and does not include support. But support work is very important for onboarding users. My idea is that, rather than not paying moderators to not discourage volunteer support people, I suggest that support people self-organize and submit a proposal like this to fund their important work.

I cannot say for other projects, but I guess that not many have a strong support force like Decred. With formal funding and more hands, it could be developed further into a unique system where crypto users not only get software with ever improving UX, they also get full-time human support without purchasing any products. At the same time, people who like doing this work can dedicate more energy to it with less or no distraction for how to get paid elsewhere. These people are also well positioned to submit bug reports to fix common UX pain points.

But outside the support area (2) I think yes, some paid work might affect existing or future volunteers in same area. Do you imagine other examples of volunteers that could get discouraged by paid moderation?",328af683594b32ee15ef19869b04827bbf87e085fa79562041765318109a4710cbb6131c931636f9298e833ead96dad886fc49cb29df2c7c9d667145fc7ccf00,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,16,a38ac9d94467684d458ccc27c1cb7dcf6a60e4d01e5624199eacdf3a7c1b3643f3da22849da3fbe16b858bae6e98142ed3efcfdb0c19b2c7078c166f758be703,1595964100,3,3.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

Re policy, the proposal has an explicit note that it does not change the policy in any way, and that means no ""extension of power"" for the mods.

I agree these terms are subjective and we don't have a formal algorithm to categorize behavior in these terms, but this is what we use in practice. If someone is pushing the same idea over and over, that is repetition turning into spam.

I haven't seen a single instance when people got ban threats or bans for difference of opinion _alone_. It is when they start saying the same thing over and over and monopolize the chat room, is when the mods have to take action. Please see my other [comment](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/32cba00b8bb0f41689ca8216e2e14a0e3d91a724c83369b3fcda02490dc119f4/comments/18).

> ""handle disputes around unfair mod action"", how would this work?

It is if someone complains that he was censored/banned unfairly, additional mods might take a look and possibly undo the action if the platform allows it. In practice though, when the case is not clear several mods often chime in to comment before any action is taken, and most (if not all) people who got banned never tried to reach out and dispute it, which might suggest the level of their interest in the project.",76d43aed4f4257c24661cc401275e1c659cf1c0e6fcf1d2ede68370240562ec7cab4931eac2e704b2d24f821fb8a327c0603c23b76f2ab28e6ad231087a2f80b,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,19,3437918e13e184af07a6daf4edcb2129ca254790598eb60025360df24cc88fff61ef4537d3d3b6e3f8989efe507d01374950ac3f5ac64ff84497731db505270d,1595965237,2,2.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

If it is rejected, we will adjust/try again/reorganize and moderation will not stop. If it is approved, this will be a fair reward and an extra incentive for moderators' continuous work.

I understand your position and I'm glad you voiced it because I think many people think this way.

To address some of your points:

Reddit is only 10% of this proposal's budget. Politeia is perhaps the most critical part (proposal submissions require careful review), followed by Matrix rooms (keeping chats usable and productive requires high availability). If this prop is rejected I might try a reduced version with only these two platforms, although the other ones are important for onboarding users.

Speaking of Reddit, r/decred can indeed work without paid mods just like the others. But Decred doesn't have to follow everything others do and can do it differently. I think paid moderation can be more sustainable.

Decred is not just an open-source project and is not just a business. It is a new kind that combines both. It has intrinsic funding unlike most open-source projects that can't afford high quality expertise or give up and sell to VC money. Unlike most businesses, Decred can afford to be open in many ways and release stuff for public use, vs bothering about ""value capture"" and hiding things to stay ahead.

I prefer to think ""is this useful work? should it be paid? how much?"" and not in terms of (and depending on) other projects that get X, Y or Z for free.

Personally, I believe that all useful work must be rewarded, and moderation is useful and under-appreciated work because it ""just works"". I will be happy if it gains more recognition. And who knows, maybe if Decred shows an example, those other projects will notice and self-organize to reward moderators too?

- Reddit removed from the budget after I was [notified](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hxxd9s/moderation_of_decred_communications_politeia/fza44fs/) that its terms do not allow to compensate moderators (thanks u/jwinterm!)
- 6 month limit reduced from $10,200 to $9,000, expected amount from $5,400 to $4,800

volunteer moderation, some people in your list that will keep the ""free"" job and culture of all people acting as moderators, who have no power of admin, but who can report problems.

I don't think they will be discouraged by the lack of pay they rejected. If they change their mind, I'll add them in the next iteration.

re non-moderator users who report bad content, they should not get discouraged by paid mods because:

1. occasionally reporting content is not the same as doing it consistently and being available every day
2. it might actually turn into a benefit - if someone demonstrates that he can consistently detect bad content and judge it fairly, he might be offered a mod role and then a paid mod role. This is in line with becomeing a contractor in other areas of Decred.
3. ""people will report less content if they know that mods are paid"" is essentially the same argument as ""people will report less bugs in software if they know that developers are paid"", which I don't think is true because of the previous points

Its always been very difficult for me to determine if we should bill for modwork. This proposal should help us gauge the stakeholder feelings on the same. 

Here is what is being done by me so that people can better understand the work being done  - 

Reddit:

All the mod actions done by me on reddit can be found here https://moddit.ffff00.news/r/decred filter ""modname"" `degeri_me` 

- I check the mod queue multiple times a day (Trying to automate this currently) and approve/delete any posts that have been caught by automod. 
- I also react (immediately if online) on spam or multi posts that slip through. 
- I have also have spent some time setting up the automod to catch almost all the spam/scams that gets posted on our subreddit. (You might have noticed a reduction in spam in the last ~6 months) 


Matrix - 

Matrix the main source of spam is the feeds from reddit (which is less now) and telegram (101 channel). 

We do sometimes have some people come in and start fudding (usually via discord or the bridged channels) but the decision to remove them requires multiple people to agree. Hence not done immediately. 

Yet to see any automated spam on matrix. But  that might change at any point. 

How I moderate matrix - 

- Enable mobile notifications. (When not on my PC)

- I have desktop notifications enabled and just go about my day (I dont stare at the chatsrooms all day) .  Any new message that get posted is shown to me on top of work I am doing, I then decide on any actions needed. 


How to bill for this has always been a conundrum for me. It is quiet ridiculous to bill for ~15 hours a day. But clearly there is work being done which keeps me away from my other work (even if momentarily).

The values given above I feel strike a fair balance. That being said if the stakeholders feel differently and say that all mod work should be volunteer based then I have no issues continuing the work being done.",30daed0e9c3d239aaa735a2808b8db67ab4e70fa5ee27dbad52077f9d44137e7a07015912876e33c57e0bb4627601809aa6ab95f738a29db59fa4738a1e12a01,d18e6dc2871b96d4e0966f3a5d95acc3c1024b7557b15d24597080e4daa68a66,5,58095c2377793751816e047fe1377cbf96c0211e319b74ed71e0e54b1a49486a52670065713de6d410557c92ff70455ded26cef913e91eb35589a1822fe4c70e,1595758170,4,4.0,False,391ab82f-84e2-422b-90e2-d6e0bf532152,degeri,

I'll vote no for some reason, first of all, you bring the risks and the community is not ready to pay for them. Another risk is to lose volunteers that do some jobs without asking for money e.g. someone who is a volunteer with technical support will stop or decrease the help if someone is paid to dedicate themselves to it. Really thing that Decred had space for various proposals right now, these things just when we get very big.

About Politeia mod, I agree with pay for that, not know because you don't have a lot of proposals every time and a lot of volunteers to get in that.

Matrix, is our coordinating tool, things need to be discussed with everyone, sometimes offtopic in channels is boring, but all discussion is needed and, as a dev contractor, I don't feel bothered.

In case someone is tired of this type of volunteer work and wants help or pass the stick, you can DM me, I divide a little of my time between work and volunteering without problems.",ecfdca90ef76bd56e99400eed7612427b4cd860fdbe5797f9ac0527122959b634aa9489124216991600ac74a1b2793c64d46a5b509f766cadaed82681bb58e00,8b9ada0d6179d50cfa1ce35814df98988517757c54f76cdbbabf6f99cce42fd8,6,1490e4397dd8ebc8077ab4f37a7ddbdd3dac0592510db20759e2eedad335983597dc4cd56c2de2a3a18bee36e6789a9e08fde3b1d743c391c77a7d8e9cec3c0e,1595758321,2,2.0,False,c4dee31b-c72d-40b7-be7e-a7d28fd645ef,guisso,

In my opinion, I think it should be something that is done more on a volunteer basis and where the community self-moderates.  There could be multiple people assigned (as outlined) across the various social media platforms that are known.  Then if moderation is needed, the community can tag them to intervene .  I'm sure most are already on those social media platforms daily, if not weekly and it wouldn't be much extra work.  Additionally, I would think those in the community wouldn't mind volunteering to moderate, following a set of guidelines.  If you have enough participation, then the workload should be distributed.  If you're looking for volunteers, I'd be willing.",4c374d273e559d39f04931c15d247a644cab9d60fb2190a69b3fa1813e3c5edaa112e055cf2a8d425358e593aca98fd4c41af6a4db65dd344607955b5a790608,29d2d833d0792acc617ff92c103f2b8183cf88a8d9abff1f72f17b6787fc3e68,7,5ec47a5aa1f207bfe55924c898b9037e9f89e4a6ed7b003ff0118e974f55d3047e62eead36c80605cc18e31ceb0eb84a73d7e4f91b7138f42f39134a796ed102,1595801132,3,3.0,False,60ec10d6-3b71-431d-9fbb-750b2e71fc19,pubpete,

In this case I share most of your concerns regarding reddit and other socials. I understand that we are in a difficult place where community is large enough that moderation is required,  but still too small for volunteers to organize and take this role organically on a larger scale. IMO as Decred isn't a company, we should hope for the community to organize more like ""unofficial""/r/  or fan forums like we see for many subject. But I have no idea how to get there, or if paid moderators could hinder the process of getting there...

However I do see a distinction when it comes to the primary chat platform. Being an open-source project isn't the same thing as having development and dev communications occurring in the public space. We can just look at the massive number of open-source projects in crypto, or from private entities, where there is no way for anyone to see what is going on or to talk with devs directly, outside of filling a git-hub issue and hoping it gets attention.  From my experience, having an open platform that anyone can join and interact directly with devs is extremely rare and a powerful tool for the community to have. In this particular case,  if moderation is an issue, I would most definitely prefer having the treasury paying for moderation and keep the space clean and efficient for dev work, than risk losing this environment, and have devs migrate to private coms like it's usually the norm...",69867e8950c7fdf3780ae67755560119a22d4cf0b3031c7b6751333baa1f0586e17d83cb7eab05e844924d4ae047c5268193323043d0cc85cd39c2085771f20e,0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9,8,c3f503f4f7f3285a20014f1c3fce3a7f2716b5f44fa8e638cb661f48e8406e1534bc32ae8bb199443bb24faa3b6d424cc3a566fd333efc8b0c062202dc60be0a,1595812631,4,4.0,False,3ffa2992-ace9-4a7d-abce-51872469e765,nnnko56,

I think this proposal turned out reasonably well, thanks for spearheading this bee. My main concern was that it would be too open-ended and allow for anybody to attempt to claim they do mod work and see what they could get away with in terms of billing. That's not really a concern of mine with the reasonable scope, budget, and people named therein, all of whom have long track records of delivering good work for the project in other domains.

Moderation requires constant attention but very little action, so while the amounts being allocated aren't large it's still a nice acknowledgment and reward for the people who will be diligently monitoring the various channels. I expect we'll get better consistency and coverage using this approach rather than having a bunch of randos addressing things in an ad-hoc manner. Having specific people named in a proposal adds accountability and transparency which is also a plus.

1. What have been your key learnings when pitching Decred to journalists in the last 6 months?
 - Have you noticed any particular narrative or project characteristic land with people more than others?
 - What have you found to be challenges with 'pitching' Decred?
 - Have you noticed an uptick in particular narratives in/around/beyond crypto that you think could provide a strong tail wind for future interest? 
 - How have you found the overall experience in terms of recruiting contributors from the community? 
 - Were there any areas or articles where there was a request from journalists for contributions where there wasn't a suitable Decred candidate? 
 - Overall how have you found the experience and the nature of the working for a (soon to be) DAO? Has it been easy / hard and in what way? 
  - This is a little meta, but you are yourself an interesting subject since you are effectively dog-fooding a new way of working - might journos find this interesting - the personal story? 

2. What are are your ambitions for the next 12 months? 
  - More of the same? 
  - Longer / more in depth features? 
  - Particular media focus - written / video / podcast / other?
  - Particular publications or narratives? 
  - Is there any particular strategy that you are personally interested to advance?
  - Any challenges you see ahead with increased noise from soon to launch projects that might steal some of Decred's airtime on subjects such as governance / DAOs / sustainable funding? 

Thanks and keep up the good work :)

This has involved formulating story ideas with different angles about the project, including ones you've mentioned around remote working, financial prospectives and technical analysis. When developing these I look at the types of articles that are getting published to get a feel for what content publications want. I've also worked with community members for pitches that are more technical. So far these pitches haven't resulted in Decred-specific content, but have led to opportunities to be quoted in articles about the current news agenda.  The plan is to continue formulating and pitching story ideas to secure Decred-specific content and I'm definitely be open to ideas from the community and will think about ways to prompt more discussion around these.

What I liked about phase 1:

- Detailed monthly reporting via [Decred Journal](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) and #marketing chat room.
- Lots of media placements generated.
- Lindsey is self-managing, initiative, easy to work with, and suggesting opportunities to community members.
- I appreciate the efforts to learn GitHub and submit documents to our repos for robust storage and reuse by others.

Moving forward, I think we do need a dedicated person handling comms with the media but I have a big concern about the efficiency and impact of phase 1 and phase 2 if it keeps the same strategy.

> Articles have been secured in leading crypto publications such as Cointelegraph and CoinDesk in addition to several mainstream publications including The New York Times, Reuters, Forbes, Business Insider and ZeroHedge. Here’s a link to the full list. 34 articles were secured, syndicated to 142 publications across 24 countries.

This sounds much better than it is: CoinDesk (x1), Forbes (x2), Reuters (x1), and ZeroHedge (x1) were all 1~4-paragraph commentary on non-Decred topics, Business Insider (x1) and The New York Times (x2) were syndications of Reuters and the NYT ones are now removed. Cointelegraph did much better with 12 articles of which 1 has several paragraphs about Decred.

Most of the media placements in the linked spreadsheets are ""commentary"" type where Decred people are quoted on various topics. Among these media placements, I have a hard time finding articles that are actually about Decred, its consensus, Politeia, Treasury, secure SPV, DEX, etc. Out of 179 items, only 46 have ""Decred"" in title. Removing price analysis and non-English links (I believe most impact comes from English posts at this point) it drops to 24, while 87 are about Bitcoin's halving. Removing the syndicated duplicates it becomes 4 items with ""Decred"" in the title, and none of them are about Decred. Put another way, out of the 34 articles mentioned, only 7 have at least 1 paragraph about Decred, and none are exclusively about it.

Articles like [this](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/does-china-control-bitcoin-and-ethereum/) do have some exploration of what Decred is or why it was made. I'd love to see more pieces like the [PoS](https://cointelegraph.com/news/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work-which-one-is-fairer) and [remote work](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/fintech-experts-share-tips-for-remote-work-during-coronavirus-quarantine/) ones that both go into some depth for important topics _and_ have enough Decred references.

At this point I'm skeptical that continuing to inject this kind of commentary to ""be part of the conversation"" is getting Decred any traction, and I don't understand the value of the syndications to tons of the small sites. Please correct me if I miss something big here.

In one [comment](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c81926b1958e54b2f294085da4ab03e9a63223f8ccd32e74a43493bf62de6185/comments/3) you mentioned the lack of project news but I think we had some workable stories in the Jan-Jun period of phase 1:

- Consensus vote with block header commitments [upgrade](https://docs.decred.org/governance/consensus-rule-voting/consensus-vote-archive/#v7) passed in Feb and activated in Mar 2020. Decentralized consensus upgrade process is the _core advantage_ of Decred that outlets keep overlooking since 2017.
- Decred turned 4 years, that is four years of active development and delivery without ICO/VC capital, hype or ""clickable"" drama.
- A bunch of high-$ projects approved and rejected via Politeia.
- Solid DEX development sounds like a good source of headlines, e.g. first testnet swap in March and the call for open testing in May (any amplification of this message helps onboarding).
- Huge and interesting work in progress was published for Treasury decentralization.
- New VSP software spec published and implementation started, this will be a huge boost for security, privacy and UX when deployed.
- June had refreshed mobile apps, Decred's Rosetta implementation and some notable Decred chain analysis insights.
- Decred's light client (SPV) implementation without middlemen is older, but it's still an awesome tech than nobody has covered yet.

More popular and/or more promoted coins have such developments covered all the time but it is a unsolved challenge for Decred, with super rare exceptions like the [CoinDesk piece](https://www.coindesk.com/decred-is-turning-its-entire-21-million-crypto-treasury-over-to-investors) from 2018.

Questions:

- Are these ""commentary"" making any difference for us?
- Is it a big challenge to get the ""real"" articles out? (it was in the past, Ditto managed to get us a few but not as much as I would hope)
- Did Decred trigger any interest in the personal finance area? (it sounds promising)
- How many press inquiries did we receive and what did they lead to? Same question for journalists' requests for comments. (trying to understand how it works and how often we get incoming requests)
- I see some interviews secured in [March](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/202003.html), [May](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/202005.html), and [June](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/202006.html). Were they published anywhere?
- I see how pitched/submitted _comments_ look like when they materialize, but what about pitched _stories_ (e.g. mentioned in [April](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/202004.html), [May](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/202005.html), [June](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/202006.html)). Where were they published?
- Looking back at phase 1, is there anything you plan to change?

Thank you for the comments. Here are my responses to your questions: 

**Are these ""commentary"" making any difference for us?**
 
These articles help build credibility and trust, particularly those in well-known mainstream publications, by demonstrating that the people behind Decred are knowledgeable, experienced and trustworthy. Adding value and sharing expertise can be an effective way to connect and engage with our target audience. 
 
Being seen as experts in our field can also lead to more journalists getting in touch seeking our advice and comments. This has occurred in the last six months. It also helps builds relationships with reporters, which can help when pitching project news and securing more Decred-focused articles. 
 
With regard to syndicated articles, these are valuable as they are amplifying the number of people we’re gaining exposure to as each site will have a different audience. Not all are small, e.g. the syndication to the New York Times. 
 
**Is it a big challenge to get the ""real"" articles out? (it was in the past, Ditto managed to get us a few but not as much as I would hope)**
 
It can be more challenging when we’re not pitching project news.
 
**Did Decred trigger any interest in the personal finance area? (it sounds promising)**
 
Not yet but it is an area I would like to continue pursuing and pitching stories/news to as it would be a good audience to reach. 
 
**How many press inquiries did we receive and what did they lead to? Same question for journalists' requests for comments. (trying to understand how it works and how often we get incoming requests)**
 
I believe there were two press inquiries that were unrelated to pitches I had sent out and both resulted in articles. The number of comments we submitted to news articles are detailed in the monthly reports, it was normally around seven per month. It was a mix of some being used and some not. 
 
**I see some interviews secured in March, May, and June. Were they published anywhere?**
 
Yes, all were published apart from one. 
 
**I see how pitched/submitted comments look like when they materialize, but what about pitched stories (e.g. mentioned in April, May, June). Where were they published?**
 
One was published as a thought leadership piece and the others led to us being featured in publications such as Reuters, Forbes, ZeroHedge and Cointelegraph, on topics that were related to the story ideas.    
 
**Looking back at phase 1, is there anything you plan to change?**
 
To secure more Decred-focused articles. I would like to clarify that this has always been the goal, it’s just not always what materializes, particularly when we’re not pitching news. 
 
Regarding the project updates you listed, I was informed that the next piece of project news we were looking to PR was the DEX upgrade.

While I think Ditto maybe landed some bigger fish (e.g. Unchained, Off-the-Chain podcasts), they did so at much higher cost. And the inroads their efforts made with journalists can still be leveraged. It feels (again, from the outside, haven't been as involved recently with these efforts) like articles are still coming at a good rate from decent publications. Basically Decred being Decred, being super lean, getting more bang for the buck than any other project in crypto. Renewing for a long-ish term also hopefully incentivizes Monde PR to keep investing in Decred, should they desire, which could see increasing returns, similar to what happens with long-time contractors. 

I think keeping the budget for more traditional PR lean also frees up budget for newer, more experimental social media type marketing that could also drive high returns.

**What have been your key learnings when pitching Decred to journalists in the last 6 months?**
 Take advantage of all available opportunities –  join existing crypto-related conversations in addition to pitching stories about Decred.
 
**Have you noticed any particular narrative or project characteristic land with people more than others?**
Not yet.
 
**What have you found to be challenges with 'pitching' Decred?**
 Securing stories focused on the project when we don't have project news. However, we’ve managed to secure a steady media presence by sharing our expertise and viewpoints about key crypto news events.
 
**Have you noticed an uptick in particular narratives in/around/beyond crypto that you think could provide a strong tail wind for future interest? **
 Weaknesses of the legacy financial system, which are becoming more apparent due to the impact of Covid-19.
 
**How have you found the overall experience in terms of recruiting contributors from the community? **
 It has been a good experience, contributors are normally willing to draw up expert comments and thought leadership articles.
 
**Were there any areas or articles where there was a request from journalists for contributions where there wasn't a suitable Decred candidate?** 
 Occasionally, mainly because they were outside our area of expertise. 
 
**Overall how have you found the experience and the nature of the working for a (soon to be) DAO? Has it been easy / hard and in what way? **
 I’ve had a very positive experience. Although we are spread across many countries and time zones,  communication is excellent. I receive comments, approval, feedback, support etc. in a timely manner. This enables us to meet deadlines and capitalize on the majority of media opportunities. It’s also a very friendly and professional community to work with.
 
**This is a little meta, but you are yourself an interesting subject since you are effectively dog-fooding a new way of working - might journos find this interesting - the personal story? **
 I prefer to stay behind the scenes and keep the focus on Decred and its spokespeople. I would consider it if the opportunity was right though.
 
**What are are your ambitions for the next 12 months? More of the same?** 
 Yes, the existing strategy includes both proactive and reactive PR outreach across multiple sectors and mediums, with the goal to secure a steady media presence.
 
**Longer / more in depth features? **
 Absolutely, this is always the goal.  
 
**Particular media focus - written / video / podcast / other?**
 The existing strategy includes outreach to all mediums, including online, print, radio, TV and podcasts. This would continue under this proposal.
 
**Particular publications or narratives?**
 Crypto, personal finance, business, tech, investing. We keep the exact pitches private but the goal is to secure articles that communicate our key messages.
 
**Is there any particular strategy that you are personally interested to advance?**
 I believe that a comprehensive PR strategy that covers all bases, as outlined in the proposal, is the best one.
 
**Any challenges you see ahead with increased noise from soon to launch projects that might steal some of Decred's airtime on subjects such as governance / DAOs / sustainable funding? **
 Not in particular. We are always competing for limited airtime against the news agenda and other company/project news updates. If there are developments from other projects in the fields of governance, DAOs etc. these could be opportunities to insert Decred into the narrative, given that we’re leaders in these fields.

One feedback

Currently, there is a lot of Decred people commenting on Bitcoin type articles. While this brings some eyes on the project,  I would like to see is us featured in more pure DCR  or governance/staking/remote work related articles. I understand it is quite difficult to pitch DCR but I would like to at least see a small change in the ratio.

As degeri noted, I would also like to see some strategy regarding building up Decred specific content. We have a collective of odd, pseudonymous, intelligent and interesting contractors who are all building a unique global currency network. There is talent we can draw on if you need to help shape up narratives and develop pitch ideas to some of your contacts to generate Decred specific content.

Perhaps there is value in you providing us with insight into the type of content that gets clicks from these publications and we can start to generate content that has a higher likelihood of being picked up.

Thanks for submitting your proposal. I am glad to see that you are taking another swing at it, but there are some problems with the proposal the way I see it.

First of all, your proposal has changed very little since the last time you submitted it. You've borrowed the template for Exitus, but in your case you don't follow through with it, as the examples of your work I've seen include little in terms of scripting (as most of it is translation), filming (recording your screen), editing, and especially feedback and dissemination.
You received a lot of feedback regarding showing and proving your skills, and while you have indeed created some video explainers on Decred, they are mostly narration-style, which in my opinion is a bit sub-par. A good chunk of your video contribution has been translation of Exitus' work, and not original content creation. What's more, we are yet to hear from other members of the RU Decred community to see if your work is any good, since most of us do not speak Russian.
For this, I'm going to echo some of the past feedback you had received: it feels like you threw together some content mostly through* translations*, just enough to show that you can deliver (at a quality which, for now, is not evident) but expect to be paid like a *content creator*.

I may be wrong, because I'm not present in all Decred channels all the time, but I don't see your presence in the Decred comms, asking for feedback like our writers do, or sharing the content you've created with a wider audience.
Yes, Exitus' work at the very beginning had few views, but he more than made up for it by hustling like crazy, promoting his work on social media, injecting his content into relevant conversations and asking for and taking feedback from people on what to improve, the quality of his deliverables and what they'd like to see made next, none of which you have done so far, from what I see, but please correct me if I'm wrong.

Moreover, I feel that stating your intention to work for Decred calculated as an amount of hours per week puts more emphasis on how much time you're willing to spend on Decred-related work as opposed to the level of quality you're going to deliver. Burning time is easy, but the Decred stakeholders are sensitive about how Treasury funds are spent. IMO the focus should be aimed at figuring out what the most valuable Decred-related content in order to spread it to people, instead of looking for just about anything Decred-related to fill a time quota, and at the moment, though there are new articles being produced, I doubt you will be able to find 80 hours worth of translation material month after month, which leads me to believe the quality of the source material you'd translate go way down, which is something I wouldn't support.

Finally, the most severe problem with this proposal is that it's very heavy on translations. Right now there is an effort underway to cluster together all translation efforts under one proposal, which is why I feel that an proposal for a single language will soon make no sense, not to mention the fact that *no Decred contractor* is just a translator.

Therefore, if you wish this to remain a translation proposal I will vote no. If you want to create content, follow in Exitus' foosteps, but most importantly engage with the community and the crypto social media, especially in your home country, because creating content no one sees will not gain you any following or recognition.

Your main complaint is that I have decided to focus on translations lately. But the point is, that I intentionally switched to this after getting feedback last time, and later on matrix, that there is more than enough content already, and it would be better if I started to adapt the existing one.
Speaking of proposal, It mentions not only what I have already done, but also what I am going to do later. (I also have to note, scripting is not written there, for now)For example I can’t make filming right now, while I don’t have a proper camera.


And your words about editing and time are quite offensive


Maybe it doesn't seem so, but translating exitus' work takes a lot of time. Much more than making my own content. As long as you've touched upon it I will explain, that to make good quality translation I must listen to his every video several times, while writing down everything he said, 
then translate it into Russian in writing form, then voice this text and not just in one piece, but in a bunch of small fragments, then edit it all, while sometimes I have to voice some pieces again, so that they fit timing better.


Regarding my presence, the main problem is that my content is in Russian. If I come in chat rooms and ask English-speaking people to rate my video, translation of an article, or something else, that would be strange at the very least. While the Russian matrix chat is pretty dead now. Same with reddit, 
I had thoughts of posting notifications on main decred subreddit, but I decided that this was not the best idea and disrespect for everyone else.

Thanks for your proposal. Ive seen your voice overs and they are pretty good.

I think at this moment more important to focus RU newcomers & cryptocommunity on Decred YouTube channel, not making special DecedRU YouTube channel until there will be good quality regular content plan & own production.

In case of translating there is a lot of work, but i suggest you step-by-step way. 
Im already creating RU-subs for Decred YT channel, you can add your translations as subs to it too. So we will translate all important content on YT faster and then can go forward on creating more stuff for RU-speaking cryptocommunity. Such as articles for cryptomedia, video content, and etc.

IMO funding proposal must have more detailed plan.
For example: Translating subs for bi-Weekly News Update - 50$/video. (100$/month)
                      Translating articles: Link + Some description why translation of this article so important - 50$/article (200$/month)
                      Writing articles for Cryptomedia about Decred - 50$/article (100$/month)

And etc. 
So your proposal will be more transparent for community and you could proof your skills with small but important steps.",c8f105f56b6f9d1708b7f5d2f46ae5bff8165eb336f7dae7df5fcddfb88997b67e4f17479bf9c03aaff286b60c7d997ca0be5b85884fc72f900f4c94124f7e05,3f53fcb88bee1c56aa643b3819ccb6c2d8808a6dd2ef935babbfea59e65673f5,15,771df3750668ffe4c067bb82402bc7b1e5bf79527655f6bc2df90d688066eda507d50dfb6de645be17751dc931185f65f061edc3c5d8ee69a9a038f63e7a0c0f,1593442264,1,1.0,False,346284d0-c3d0-40f8-90db-789b264048c9,zzombie,

I have two concerns for any translation initiaitive: quality and audience.

Quality is a common problem we have faced over the years. It is impossible to directly evaluate the quality of a translation without speaking its language, so all we can is to rely on indirect signals:

- Good English writing skills don't guarantee that the translation is good but increase the chance of it. In that regard, text quality of this proposal and replies is good.
- Past contributions. Pretty much everyone who has translated Decred content so far has also contributed in other areas (onboarding new users, helping with support, writing articles and insightful comments, reviewing other's texts, reporting bugs, running events, etc).
- Multiple reviewers/contributors for the translation. For example, I don't speak Arabic but the fact that @arij's translation has another person to give feedback and even [tweak](https://github.com/Insaf01/decred-journal-ar/pull/12) the translation makes me more confident about its quality. Another example is Spanish content produced by the Latam team. They have quite a lot of people who can review and improve the translations.

I wish that a few other Russian speaking people could chime in and comment on what has been translated so far.

Audience: I see only a handful of followers on both your YouTube and Medium. I'm not sure that consistent translation/production of content without an audience is the best idea. Ideally, I'd like to see one quality translation placed in a popular place to build up interest in the project, before investing too much in translations that will get very little views.

The 50% Yes votes as of writing this suggest to me that (1) the stakeholders like the general idea and (2) they like this proposal much more than the [first](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/92e3f2176b332c1aea5887acd2324c2cd730ec450e563df52ddae9d5927d5d36) one. However, the 50% No votes confirm my guess that something is holding them back, and I think it is uncertainty about the impact of this work.

Some questions to get ideas.

> (why:)  russian community is pretty big (second language of the internet after all) and there is a noticeable lack of information

How do you know lack of information in Russian is the #1 problem of the Russian community adopting Decred? Could the #1 problem be anything else?  Social proof, businesses accepting crypto, getting their first Decred from someone they know, etc?

Why will Decred die if the Russian community that doesn't understand English is unable to use the existing information? 
- unable to learn English
- unable to translate the information into English with Chrome's translator
- unable to find someone in their social circle who knows English to explain Decred to them
- unable to find someone tech-savvy in their social circle to explain Decred to them
- unable to take intellectual responsibility of their financial future by any means possible

(Could these be the same people who are late adopters, or who would never buy Decred or crypto?)

Did you try other ways of providing this information? Like visiting people in person and explaining it to them. Getting tech-savvy Russians to understand Decred, and having them explain it to _all_ their family members. Standing outside the supermarket and explaining Decred to people, etc.

You'd be surprised by what turns out to have impact.

How do you know the Russian community is interested in _any_ detailed information about Decred? Maybe the _only_ information it's interested in is Yes it's good, buy this many coins, or No it's bad, don't buy because of this reason, and to have this information presented by people they trust.",776170292696ff267255d70c9c45fcbdf20aeed7159628e94689e14fafc2b23e57161cbb9248bdc95f9ede89cfe244481a372daaaa6ee1581d2b44e747657d06,c2a61bde5331bc52a7f83bb4d0e7f2d20909b3a6877cc1bbc4e17c03ea300eac,21,d6c1dddd86e06e245c5ea737408fa1b1b79f843e8363d29730f222b61cc0cfebdeb3f5d5c85acc4765ecad0965f5c6ac2e9bbb994d54531c9e6bdc1239281804,1593916275,1,1.0,False,c140130c-1257-415d-837f-7ff13e64eb42,uncertain_about_tomorrow,

I believe efforts to further decentralize development from the original C0 group are very valid and significant for the ecosystem as a whole (and while I'm not a C0 employee and can't speak for them I also think they themselves are the major proponent of decentralization via e.g. the recent treasury work). 

Since this might affect future proposals by myself and other independent devs and groups, I'd like to point out some things that jumped to me while reading this proposal. I'll put my own opinion on these but I'm generally uncertain on most of them so I'm very interested to know the opinion and eventual voting outcome on them.

> Matrix Chat

As a corporate entity, it's reasonable (and expected) that you'll run your own operational infrastructure (emails, chat, office software, accounting packages, etc). C0 has a private chat infrastructure for its employees. 

Is funding for a generic matrix server something that the treasury should be used for? If I (or a group of BR devs for example) wanted to run our own matrix server, would it be reasonable to ask for the treasury to fund the administrative burden of this? What if it's a bridged discord server?

I'm personally contrary to this in this particular proposal: either the decred community only needs one matrix server (falling under some contractor's responsibility to run) or (my personal preference) it needs _none_ and everyone is free to join from whatever server they want.

I understand that due to operational reasons, it's not entirely efficient to _not_ have an ""official looking"" server (a single URL we can direct incoming people to) and that's why I hedged on the previous paragraph. But in any case, it doesn't feel right to me to have the treasury support more than one server.

> Dcrdata

I'm reasonably ok with this one: since RG seems to be the primary contractor developing dcrdata, running a testnet instance seems reasonable. 

> Other Servers

Most of these also seem like something that shouldn't fall on the treasury to fund for the moment. I'd make an exception for the seeders, but see my last point on policy below.

> Code Management

Seems reasonable.

> Website & Blog

Why do we need anything other than the existing blog.decred.org for a blog? Is it _failing_ to publish relevant material?

> Who

I'd really love if the listed devs would participate more in the existing chats. I don't really follow dcrdata development that closesly so I may be missing their interactions but I feel I haven't seen any of the listed devs on the open chat channels (but again, this is probably just me not actively looking for them).

> Cost

> Server hosting: $3000
> Server administration: $6000

I feel these are a bit on the high side (excluding dcrdata) though I'm definitely biased here: I'm only familiar with my own installs which are **tiny** and probably have nowhere near the traffic the planetdecred infra sees or will see. I'd expect more input from other syadmins here.

> Local Events

No comment since this is way outside my area of influence.


## Policy Debate

Now, the real question this proposal brings forward IMO is the policy question on how should Decred's infra, as maintained by the various contractors, be financed by the treasury? 

For example, mainnet seeders: who should be ""allowed"" to run one and who should be ""allowed"" to bill the treasury for the operational overhead of running one? Obviously seeders are a somewhat sensitive asset, so only ""reputable community members"" (in whatever way we'd want to define that) should run seeders that get included in the widely distributed binaries. And given an increase in the size of network I can see how running one might get expensive. Having a uniform policy seems initially the most sensible alternative (e.g. up to X USD/month for anyone running a seeder) though that fails in other directions (someone locating a server on a high cost, highly accessible location vs low cost, high latency location).

We _can_ always decide to do this in an ad hoc way, so each individual proposal by each individual contractor defines all aspects of the operation but this seems wasteful (and needlessly political) so I'd like to start this debate on whether it is now (or would be in the future) better to define some clear cut policy for such operational costs.

Funding publicly accessible websites, especially critical infrastructure like the explorer and the Insight socket.io server used by many wallets, makes sense, but I was under the impression it was not allowed to fund *the resources used by developers to do their work*.

I think your suggestion on getting more clarity on infrastructure costs is wise. That is also why I have included many items on this proposal, grouped together that are low cost. I believe it is important that all costs are approved by stakeholders via proposals. 

For local events, the reason it was included on this proposal was because it is a small cost item, which many of the items on this proposal are. I didn't want to burden stakeholders with lots of proposals for every little thing. The goal is to get all expenses covered by proposals. But I will look at the feedback and remove these disparate items if necessary.

Unless there's an issue I'm unaware of,  https://decred.org/contributors/#development  is pretty neutral and gives the exact same visibility to all devs and contrator groups. There is no reason to fund an alternate public facing page only for a subset of them.  Plus decred.org is not a contractor group and has almost no mention of Company 0 except in the history section and in the contributors page previously linked. Planet Decred however is a contractor group that will be billing the treasury and potentially competing with other groups for funding.

>Just want to point out that this is probably true for every contractor (it's true for the dev contractors in BR I personally know and for me) so it shouldn't be considered as part of any arguments from anyone.

I find it to be right on point with what we are discussing. What should be covered out of pocket and what should be funded by the treasury. I find it hard to believe that the same services I am describing and proposing to run, transparently in a proposal, have not been incurring any cost on the treasury from decred.org.

I also find the matrix p2p work and removing home servers all together to be very interesting, but it doesnt seem like thats where we are today. Its still in development.

> I'm personally, ""philosophically"" in favor of the treasury funding no home servers. 

This would be a consistent view. If the community was to agree on this, I would find that quite acceptable and unbiased. 

> Presumably you'll still be using the rooms initially hosted in the decred.org homeserver

That is not my intention. Rooms that are primarily composed of activity from planetdecred developers would be in a room that is homed on planetdecred.org. The domain is a specific centralized component we are providing a solution for.

> If this is meant to split the decred community chat rooms due to differing moderation style desired then I'm even more against it

The intention is not to split anyone. It is to recognize collaboration, independence, and inter-dependence. Previously our work had grown out of chat rooms that were not matrix based. This sometimes made communication cumbersome. Matrix was specifically chosen because of the federated mode compatibility with the existing decred.org server.  Since the planetdecred.org team has setup our own server, we've already made enhancements such as optimizing the way our github notification bot works which has provided a noticeable boost in productivity. We are looking at several matrix server features we can utilize in the future to improve our operations. We didn't have to rely on anyone else to get this done. Requiring the use of decred.org for our services creates all kinds of authorization bottlenecks that centralize the process.",a5a4a5f552a39f567211d22a87c56fb7c4a0c929736f1a7c17293fd40cdf474d7970ae8b4cc7da72d56c0dadbfb810577659a225f45463ff719f18d89b4b5600,eb82b264d3dad64ca85f5167f6bd5cf64897d546159cdb12303edd50cc7b47d1,13,12efaea9b5f0932227f422e1dbf950fcab21194923c96626d25d71c86088a6c38d36cdf1b109c33b8ab224005a7425aadca05d733e583b83ab842cf0bd93cf0c,1591296717,1,1.0,False,01ed6d12-2e09-4905-8135-33b863b8496b,raedah,

It also provides the community more visibility into our work.  Upstream dcrdata often has had long development and release cycles that have not coincided with our testing and delivery cycles. We will continue to seek out ways to coordinate with all dcrdata developers, but at this point the cost and benefits do not indicate that we need to create an unnecessary dependency that is easily avoidable. The development of 'multiple style' dcrdata interfaces can create diversity in design that would serve a broader user base who may have different preferences. I've fielded many requests from the community on features they would like to see. When we **submit the features we develop that are approved by the stakeholders, if for whatever reason other dcrdata maintainers do not feel like including the changes in the master branch, the PD developers would then have the ability to maintain the changes in our own branch and deploy the features to the community on accessible servers**. Likewise, our branch could be merged into upstream after further refinement if consensus is achieved.

For the last ~1yr dcrdata has had long review cycles and slower development in general as a direct consequence of @buck54321 and myself dedicating a large portion of our time to dcrdex.  I hope to direct a larger portion of my time to dcrdata in the future, but I acknowledge this slow down.

I understand the value in hosting your own feature branches to showcase your work that is either not yet deployed on the main dcrdata site or was not merged.  You seem to have done this with the attack cost calculator and some mixing charts that both took time to merge, and **I suspect the community benefited from those previews**.  Although I will say there were *very* good reasons for the charts PRs delays that I'd prefer not to get into but heavy resource usage was a main reason -- to your point about optimization reducing resource costs -- and that had to be addressed before we could even think about putting it on the main dcrdata site that needs to handle heavy traffic and cannot block for minutes while regenerating charts data.  This was evident on dev machines, and became very clear when deploying these PRs to alpha.dcrdata.org, which was quite crippled as a result.  An early version of the mix charts was based on rough estimates while the necessary DB work was done, and I'm glad we ended up with charts that reflect the on chain data with absolute fidelity rather than estimates.  But again, I totally appreciate that it was valuable to show those estimates on your pages ahead of the final implementation.

But as far as not including the changes in the master branch, I need to say that does not happen very often.  When that does happen it is usually because there was insufficient communication of either the vision for that thing or even the intent to develop it, or it simply doesn't work out the way we wanted.  The ""visual blocks"" page is one such case I will acknowledge as being still not ready for prime time despite ample discussion of the concept prior to starting it, and **I do not think this was any fault of the RG devs**.  **I have closed more than one of my own PRs after it did not pan out**, so this is not favouritism or self dealing.  That said, I'd like if you could clarify the language of ""features we develop that are approved by the stakeholders"" because as far as I know there haven't been any specific dcrdata features given stakeholder approval to develop.  I inquire about this because the implication is we are rejecting stakeholder approved work out of hand, and I've not heard this even suggested prior to this statement.

> Our servers will also providce redundancy in the case of server outages, can be used for independent verification of data points being retrieved, and there are also privacy reason why data queries should be distributed.

Multiple sources for independent verification and privacy is important.  I always encourage people with these concerns to consider running their own dcrdata instances.  I think redundancy in case of outages is a very minor concern though.  I'm pretty proud of our globally load balanced deployment that has seen essentially no down time while maintaining extremely low latencies in most regions of the world... maybe one incident with a TLS certificate in years.

> Overall, I am quite happy with the great progress that all dcrdata developers have made together.

We appreciate that.  Likewise, I have always appreciated the continual efforts from RG to drive dcrdata forward.

Thanks for putting up the server. I think its needed. You have demonstrated that its not terribly difficult to do. This was not something that was being debated though. The question remains open on what people should fund out of their own pockets, and who is able to bill the treasury with costs associated with maintaining infrastructure that is used by the community. If there is any infrastructure that is currently funded by the treasury that is handled by contractors I would expect it to be an open bidding process. If infrastructure is not funded by the treasury, then there would be no bias. If there is no competition, does the treasury just have to foot a bill of .. ?  There are just too many unknown. That is why I have brought this proposal to the community and offered to provide these services at a low cost. If others want to put services up for free, thats fine, but what are the costs which the treasury is already paying for decred.org ?

> disagree that experience in operating a centralized CSPP server instance will be relevant

Having access to server logs is quite necessary for debugged, contributing, and accelerates domain knowledge in the area being worked on.

> running a second server also splits the anonymity set.

This is specifically why I labeled it a fallback server, so as to not split the anonymity set. Code improvements can also be made to the clients so that if a primary server is not available, a secondary server would be tried. This would prevent the condition of server connection failure where the client stops the purchasing of tickets all together. Currently its a bottleneck that could have direct effects on the health of the network. 

> This is a serious issue: are the blog operators failing to publish relevant material that you've submitted about Decred?

The process of creating this content has been managed behind closed doors. Perhaps not in all cases, but in a great many.

> I publish (and will continue to publish) my writings on my own page.

Yes, and this is exactly why the PD community decided to just go and put up our own blog. Same principle. Should it be funded and sanctioned by the stakeholder? Is the decred.org blog funded and sanctioned by the stakeholders? Same principle.

> The point of reproducible binaries is to not need multiple locations.

My point is that if you have reproducible binaries, you can_ have downloads available from multiple locations and verify that they are the same. Having only a single website that users go to fetch binaries is not necessary, creates no advantages for the end user. I am proposing we move away from having a single website that is the official website for downloads. Anyone can build these and post them on their website themselves. So the primary question this discussion seems to be circulating around is should the stakeholders designate a single party to do this, or multiple parties? Who should the treasury fund and who should they not? Presumably, decred.org bills the treasury for this work. I haven't seen any analysis on the costs of this, but my aim is to get this work covered by a proposal. I am not asking someone else to do it because I know that is bad form. I am saying that we are willing to do it.

>  It's one thing to decentralize the servers. Decentralizing the conversation makes it a little more difficult to coordinate the development.

Thats exactly what we have proposed to do. We are decentralizing the servers. Users on both servers can join any rooms. Room will still be appropriately organized for the topic at hand and open to users from other home servers. The point is not to create any unnecessary duplication, but this is a nuanced topic for how rooms should best be organized to facilitate the advancement of decred. That is usually up to the creator of the room. All that is being proposed here is that we should further decentralized decred by not having an 'official' home server. The PD team already has a proven track record of accomplishments and are prepared to take on this task.

The testnet servers you referenced are for lightning, which is different then a standard tx faucet. But you could also easily put up a testnet faucet as matheusd did above. See my comments there.

>I also think \[c0\] are the major proponent of decentralization via e.g. the recent treasury work

Agreed. And while they are the ones who are currently getting this done, its a major problem that so much talent ends up centralized within a single group which has often operated in their own internal fashion. This may not be their fault, but the future of decred depends on the community looking at how we can foster and fund the growth of other groups.

> As a corporate entity, it's reasonable (and expected) that you'll run your own operational infrastructure (emails, chat, office software, accounting packages, etc).

The reality of how we operate is that 100% of RG work is currently for the benefit of Decred. We often have incurred many of these costs ourself without seeking treasury funding. These costs were not a terrible burden. Due to the distinction of corporate identities being separate from ""the"" decred organization itself, this is why I have decided that the infrastructure we are building for our operations needs to be under a decred organization that is approved by the stakeholders.

> due to operational reasons, it's not entirely efficient to not have an ""official looking"" server

I will speak to my primary reasoning first. Whenever someone operates a server, they become a point of failure. They become the **trusted party** responsible for server up time, they choose how frequently software updates are deployed and what software packages are used. They are responsible for the data security of the server. In some places admin level permissions are granted for privileged operations. Simply put, its a gatekeeper. I wont create a detailed list of potential situations because there are too many possible cases which could have a definite positive or negative outcome for decred. The infrastructure the community uses is a technology that facilitates how we operate. Having redundancy not just in server instances, but diversity in operational protocol and personnel will make decred stronger.

On the not so technical side, there is a question of culture. A single server identity does becomes a centralizing force for culture and brand. Now on this point some may argue that we want_ cohesion to keep us together because that makes us stronger, and I would not dismiss that argument off hand. Up till this point I was skeptical that a proposal such a this was needed and that was why I didn't act on it till now. But I do see calls from around that there may be a broader decred community outside of what some people feel is the set Overton window on the primary decred.org chat server. This may be the case now today, or it may be more relevant at some point in the future. I believe in the idea of voice or exit, and want to give alternative view points a place to organize if they need a place to exit to. That to me is true decentralization. The cross-server communication modes that matrix supports strikes the right balance of independence and compatibility to facilitate ongoing dialog which will allow for diversity as well as unity. As one of the longest standing decred community team leaders, and one that is not part of the founding group, I feel it is my responsibility to take this action for the betterment of decred.

Now on the practical, it does open up the question of how much decentralization is needed and what should the treasury fund. Having 1 official server is not decentralized, but having 2 official servers is. An additional benefit is that this would easily silence outside critics who would take a single chat server as a metric to criticize our level of decentralization. For both of my above points on the technical and cultural nature of this decision, I urge the stakeholders to take careful consideration, now and in the future, of the health of our technology operations and our culture, as well as the available funds in the treasury and the cost a proposal will incur. The items I have listed in this proposal were grouped together because they are of a low cost and have high potential value relative to their cost.

> I'd really love if the listed devs would participate more in the existing chats.

Agreed, and I think the above points on the creation of a new chat server with cross over capability will reduce barriers in connectivity and culture. PD also has plans outside the scope of this proposal to continue taking action into the future to improve dialog.

> RG seems to be the primary contractor developing dcrdata, running a testnet instance seems reasonable.

It has recently created large improvements in our development-testing-feedback cycles to be able to quickly deploy new features to our own instances to demo to the decred community. It also provides the community more visibility into our work. Upstream dcrdata often has had long development and release cycles that have not coincided with our testing and delivery cycles. We will continue to seek out ways to coordinate with all dcrdata developers, but at this point the cost and benefits do not indicate that we need to create an unnecessary dependency that is easily avoidable. The development of 'multiple style' dcrdata interfaces can create diversity in design that would serve a broader user base who may have different preferences. I've fielded many requests from the community on features they would like to see. When we submit the features we develop that are approved by the stakeholders, if for whatever reason other dcrdata maintainers do not feel like including the changes in the master branch, the PD developers would then have the ability to maintain the changes in our own branch and deploy the features to the community on accessible servers. Likewise, our branch could be merged into upstream after further refinement if consensus is achieved. Our servers will also providce redundancy in the case of server outages, can be used for independent verification of data points being retrieved, and there are also privacy reason why data queries should be distributed. Overall, I am quite happy with the great progress that all dcrdata developers have made together.

Planet Decred is presented as a contractor group and will be promoting itself and not offer equal visibility for C0 or any other individual or group because by definition they are from different groups or ""sets"". You are literally asking the treasury to fund your online portfolio.  Me being happy or not with decred.org is irrelevant because stakeholders voted and the website was delivered and paid for and is totally impartial. 

I agree that we should have multiple websites, but the only way I see this working and helping with decentralization, is if Planet Decred is also an impartial entity which do not promote a group more than an other, do not request direct funding in its name, and provides equal visibility for all individual devs or groups without distinction. However that is absolutely not what is proposed. The way this proposal is laid out  Planet Decred is in competition with company 0 and other devs,  not with decred.org. And I don't want any of the contractors public websites to be funded from the treasury. In short I believe the ""Planet Decred"" label cannot be representing a particular set of devs or request funding if it is to be an impartial public website like Decred.org. If it does, like currently poposed, we are not decentralizing the website, we are partitioning visibility in favor of one set of devs.

If planet decred isn't that impartial website and organization it cannot be funded by the treasury in my eyes...
Just like n self-employed worker doesn't bill clients to built his own online portfolio or public facing website.

For the record I'm totally in agreement to vote in favor of funding all the dev work made by RG devs on dcrandroid, dcrios, dcrdata, etc...  but there is no way I would vote set a precedent in using the treasury to favor visibility for one set of many devs over the others.

Let me clarify the confusion - I can see Treasury supporting running of services which are alternative to services which are ran by decred.org / core team. I don't know the whole list of services, but things like DCR data explorer, faucet, mixer servers, etc.

What I was trying to say that spinning up a blog or a matrix chat should be not part of that.

Also, I saw that you decreased the requested amount to $5,000 USD. Actually, I don't mind supporting even $10,000 USD or more if it's required. The last thing I want to see is a group of developers who deliver good work to be discouraged by being pushed on prices.

I think your update on the proposal was to the right direction. If you need more resources to run those ""core services"", please ask for those funds. Or we can back-pay in 6 months if we see the costs being actually higher. I think everybody will be 100% happy with that.

**Disclaimer**

To be honest, I almost didn't post a comment on this, because even though I am a **huge** proponent of decentralization and really want to encourage and foster it, I also realize that I'm one of the current leads and therefore any criticism I give will probably be perceived as me trying to discourage it. 
However, I also think it's important to actually foster real decentralization, and, unfortunately, while there are a couple of aspects here that I think make sense, I don't feel like the vast majority of this proposal will do anything in that regard.

I put this up front to try and be as transparent as possible for those reading the comments.

**Positive Aspects**

On the positive side, providing additional and alternative services such as an explorer and a seeder, particularly for testnet, is a useful addition the aids in decentralization.

Whether or not the Treasury should be paying for that is another matter, since, I personally think that would generally set a pretty bad precedent given that, realistically speaking, it is extremely low cost to provide the majority of
such services and I would expect anyone who is already invested in the Decred network, such as a development organization, is already highly incentivized to provide them in order to help protect their investment.

For example, the proposal mentions that ""we also run a dcrdata dev server for our team members to quickly get access to a dcrdata development environment"".  That is very much part of the organization's internal development environment and
practices and is a cost of doing business.  I don't attempt to charge the treasury for my development hardware, and I wouldn't expect any development organizations to either.  Worse, going down that path would open the door for everyone who
has ever written a single line of code attempting to charge the Treasury for hardware upgrades, network infrastructure, etc.  Another example is the case of the Matrix chat section, where this proposal is effectively trying to externalize the cost
of using a freely-available and decentralized chat service (Matrix) to the Treasury.

However, in pure terms of decentralization, I definitely agree with the value add there.

**Negative Aspects**

Unfortunately, the rest of the things the proposal mentions do not, in my opinion, help with decentralization at all.

> Matrix

Matrix is already federated and the home server really has nothing to do with decentralization at all.  Anyone can setup their own home server, use the matrix.org home server, or choose any other home server of their liking.  There
is nothing wrong with, nor preventing, PD, or anyone else, from setting up new channels with their own moderation policies.  The community is already small enough that I don't think attempting to silo people even more would be all that useful,
but that aside, it really has nothing to do with running a home server or not, and running a home server is definitely not something I think the Treasury should be paying for since it isn't required at all.

> Code Management

Why does the Treasury need to pay for a free Github organization?  If RG wants to house the projects it works on in an organization under the banner Planet Decred, as opposed to RG, that sounds perfectly fine to me, but I fail to see why a proposal and request for Treasury funds is needed for that.

This is already long enough, so I won't detail the others, but the summary is that aside from the few positives at mentioned at the beginning that could make sense, the vast majority of this seems to have little to do with meaningful decentralization.

You are correct the costs are extremely low for many of the items that had been listed. This was done because I recall past proposals being criticized for under bidding services, in which it had been stated that they were non competitive and not supporting the proper incentive structure. So I aimed to be fully transparent on any costs occurring. Perhaps this should not apply to low cost items. The dev server costs were included for the same reason, for transparency. I will revise this.

> running a home server is definitely not something I think the Treasury should be paying for since it isn't required at all.

Regarding server costs in general, I currently don't have transparency on the degree to which any other servers being operated for decred, or the hours billed to the treasury for maintaining them, are covered by the treasury. I would be surprised to learn they have not incurred any cost to the treasury. Having publicly available information on this would likely solve confusion in this area for the future.

> Why does the Treasury need to pay for a free Github organization?

This proposal does not associate any costs with this. The description of such work is only included to be informative of our intended actions.

>If RG wants to house the projects it works on in an organization under the banner Planet Decred, as opposed to RG, that sounds perfectly fine to me, but I fail to see why a proposal and request for Treasury funds is needed for that.

The work we have done for dcrios, dcrandroid, dcrlibwallet has been funded by the decred treasury. We view these as property of the decred community. I did not want to make a unilateral move to PD without proposing it, discussing it, and stakeholder approval. But yes, we could have done so independently. 

> The community is already small enough that I don't think attempting to silo people even more would be all that useful

Our aim is to support collaboration across teams and diversity in operational protocols/tools. As a historical reference, the way that RG was started was due to discussing projects with the early decred development teams and there being stark contrasting views on how projects should be managed (use of agile methods, project boards, recruiting practices.) RG applied its own style which has now proven to yield great contributions to advancing decred. Our plan is to expand our efforts through PD to a broad decred development community, and support collaboration wherever possible. While we balance unity and difference, diversity will strengthen us, a mono culture will weaken us. As the decred economy continues to expand, cross team collaboration will only become more important. The steps PD is taking are to prepare for this.

I don't see how the Planet Decred website could be impartial and not give more visibility to devs grouping under the banner ""Planet Decred""...  and thus I wouldn't want treasury to fund this initiative.

I could absolutely see the treasury fund an initiative for a planet decred website if it isn't also a branding for a group of dev, and is totaly impartial to _all_ devs  both in name and content.

You may think that I'm insisting on semantics, but I see the difference as extremely significant going forward.  If a website like Planet Decred was funded by the treasury, as it was initially described in the proposal, it would open the door to funding websites not only for communities, but also for corporate entities, and individual devs, because it would only be fair to provide them with equal visibility for their ""set of devs"" using the treasury.  The fact that Planet Decred was described as an open community that anyone can join, changes nothing to the fact that it's an organization that doesn't represent the totality of Decred devs. 

I hope you understand the distinction I'm trying to make, and I encourage you to either go ahead with Planet Decred as a private initiative, or to revise the proposal  so that the website is presented as an impartial front of the project like decred.org and do not associate with a specific group of devs. Personnally I would be in support of both options.

#### Repository location

As long as the code is open, has nice license and maintainers are welcoming contributions, I don't care too much about which account is the owner.

I might be reading it wrongly, but I don't think you need stakeholder approval to establish PD or move repositories to it if the maintainers and license don't change. Moving dcrandroid to RG or PD account is reasonable because currently it is confusing that dcrandroid and dcrios have the same maintainer but reside in different accounts. What is important is that things don't break (redirects, etc).

#### Infrastructure resilience

> Decred mainnet and testnet network seeders, a testnet faucet, a fallback privacy mix server, and running a planetdecred vsp.  We can also improve our secure build process in order to add signed builds for dcrd, dcrwallet to the PD download section, as well as direct downloads for android mobile wallet apks.

This is a very good idea and I don't see why it was removed from the proposal. All of that is needed to increase resiliency.

re funding **planetdecred.org**: two things here. One is whether it will promote/favor any specific group of developers or simply host information about projects/services hosted at that domain. If it is the former, then I agree with nnnko56 that the Treasury should not fund it. If it is the latter, I see no issue. The other thing is the cost. $500 for 6 months in the 2nd revision of the proposal looks reasonable.

re funding **decredpower.com**: it's a nice directory but personally don't see it ""valuable enough"" to be funded from Treasury.

The _real_ infrastructure, on the other hand, such as seeders, mixers, explorers, Matrix, Git hosting, archives of important knowledge, and much more, is valuable and I see no problem funding it from the Treasury.

I'd love to see a second **CSPP server**. I like pretty much everything about our privacy tech, except I don't follow C0's [recommendation](https://blog.decred.org/2019/08/28/Iterating-Privacy/) to not run alternative mixing servers. There should be at least 2-3. Anonymity set is a strong concern, but so is fault tolerance and privacy (server admins do learn some metadata about clients and it makes sense to have an alternative). Server mesh will ultimately resolve this but I don't expect it to happen any time soon (my personal projection is 1+ year).

re **Matrix**: @matheusd made a good point that each corporate entity should maintain their own operational infrastructure. But I think there is a difference between private infra exclusive to the corporate entity, and adding public servers to the federation supporting the open Decred Matrix community. I don't know the Matrix protocol good enough to know how exactly adding more homeservers helps, but do I know that we need two things: more than one copy of chat history and more than one server running important rooms. It also matters who actually _controls_ the rooms even if they are hosted by >1 server. When everything is normal we should aim to minimize the fracturing of the community. But if there is any issue with rooms controlled by one group, there should be fallback rooms where work can continue.

In general, I very much appreciate when people run stuff for free for the benefit of Decred, but relying on that alone is too naive. To me that is the [same problem](https://blog.companyzero.com/2015/11/bitcoins-biggest-challenges/) that led to the introduction of Treasury at the protocol level. Even if altruism would provide everything that we need, I still would like to see these people getting paid one way or another, so that they can focus working on Decred without distractions. Absorbing costs is generous but it may not work forever.

> Other Servers - Most of these also seem like something that shouldn't fall on the treasury to fund for the moment. I'd make an exception for the seeders

The decred testnet faucet has suffered substantial downtime over the last few years. The data to analyze the failure was only available to those with authorization to access it. Admins have frequently been unresponsive. If there were multiple testnet faucets available, developers would have been unblocked from getting the testnet funds they needed to complete their tasks. The cost in productivity has exceeded the cost it would take to deploy an additional one for backup. Several community members have requested a secondary CSPP server. There have been many cases where the CSPP server has gone down and interrupted ticket purchasing for a large number of users of the decred blockchain. When it fails, there is no secondary one for users to point their client to. Developers on my team, who have worked on the CSPP code, are not able to gather any data from the server logs on what caused the server failure. In the future we plan on moving the CSPP code base to a mesh mode which will require multiple servers to operate, and will require more personal to have experience operating instances of the CSPP server in order to test and troubleshoot bugs and new features. Our community vsp / staking system has not been healthy. Too many times a new users has tried to setup Decrediton with a VSP, and has encountered numerous failures. Some users outright give up and walk away from Decred. The failures are sometimes related to conditions that occur in Decrediton, sometimes the vsp, sometimes a combination. Its not a good on-boarding experience to decred staking to go into a large troubleshooting session to try and get a vsp configured. **This is why RG took the initiative in building the code to switch to a non-account based VSP system, to one that uses ticket based authentication instead.** After careful analysis of the issue, we determined there was a fundamental flaw in the original design. It will become a turn key experience for users and in my opinion will solve the biggest issue we have today in on-boarding. PD will monitor the situation and may choose to run a vsp or partner with other vsp operators in order to maintain high quality standards.

>Why do we need anything other than the existing blog.decred.org for a blog? Is it failing to publish relevant material?

The information published on that blog certainly comes with its own slant, approval process, sometimes with negligent omissions. It provides a lot of great information and I am open to collaborating on posts to it. Its a great example for how PD can better communicate our achievements to a larger audience. This is why we are taking action now. PD community members may choose to come together on our own posts and publish them ourselves. An additional blog comes at low cost, and with the decred consumers frequently desiring more insight into current developments, I expect a secondary blog for the decred community from PD will get a warm welcome from our users.

>>Server hosting: $3000 Server administration: $6000

>I feel these are a bit on the high side

This breaks down to $500 a month in hosting costs, and $1000 a month in admin work hours. Initial hosting costs may be lower, but I wanted to give us some buffer since this is a 6 month commitment. A majority of sys admin work is often just in setting up and deploying new servers, and several items listed in the proposal would require new setups. Ideally it would just run itself at that point, but regular software updates have to be done to maintain security, and inevitably there are failures that occur which have to be tended to. Sys admins support developers by making configuration updates they need to support new requirements from developers. Currently we have been experiencing increased dcrdata dev server costs due to the high cpu, disk, ram requirements to process large amounts of data. We can quickly get developers unblocked by increasing the resource requirements but at a cost. We can also make software optimizations that can reduce hardware costs, sometimes dramatically, but these software changes also have a cost, take time, and require we have developers to allocate to these tasks. These are a few of the issues that need to be managed on a day to day basis. $1000 a month translates to only several days out of the month for one individual to focus on these tasks. I believe it will be enough for now, but I also see these costs growing in the future. As decred grows, so will our need for increased data security and high availability up-times.

Thanks for putting up this proposal, it's nice to see efforts to further decentralize the project. I do have a few questions though, maybe you can clarify a few things for me.

I see no mention and/or funds requested for dcrandroid or dcrios, so after this proposal would your team and most other devs under this new banner continue to bill toward dev proposals put up by C0 or are new proposals expected to come later from RG for this work? When I saw this proposal go up, my first thought was that it would encompass all dev work from RG (or planet decred) so that we have 2 major contractors groups approved directly by stakeholders, which would be fitting for the decentralized treasury changes coming up.

Regarding Planet Decred, I think it's a great initiative, and if some devs want to group under this banner why not! I expect and hope we'll have many organizations of all kinds contributing over time (individuals, corporate, community based, maybe even sub DAOs).  However I find myself hesitant for the treasury to pay for server and web maintenance for any such organization front page. If feels pretty much the same as if C0 was billing the treasury for https://www.companyzero.com/ server and maintenance.  (and they aren't billing for this as far as I know ?)

Finally regarding decredpower,  it's a cute page and original idea. However I fail to see how it's worth 3000$ over a six month period (considering prior work is not requested). For example the last modification date as of the writing of this comment is ""2020-04-14"", which was almost 2 months ago.  It's essentially a static page which should be really low maintenance, and I'm pretty sure resources wise it doesn't require a 500$/month server. If there is other features planned or upcoming dev work, the description should be part of this proposal IMO.

Regarding alternate servers for  CSPP, testnet/faucet, I agree.

Just want to point out that this is probably true for _every_ contractor (it's true for the dev contractors in BR I personally know and for me) so it shouldn't be considered as part of any arguments from anyone.

> Having 1 official server is not decentralized, but having 2 official servers is

I disagree because this can be followed by: 3 ""more decentralized"". 5 is ""more decentralized yet"". And one server per user would be maximally decentralized. The entire point of matrix is that any individual homeserver matter _very little_ and in fact, just two days ago they announced a p2p matrix PoC that allows one to run a personal homeserver in the browser (https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix/).

As I wrote in the original, I'm personally, ""philosophically"" in favor of the treasury funding _no_ home servers. I accept that today that isn't practical given that we want outside users to be able to find and join #support easily enough and the original matrix homeserver craps out from time to time. 

More concretely: I plan to run a personal home server myself (originally just for me). If I open it up for outside registration, does that mean I can seek funding from the treasury to run it? What should be the policy for establishing and seeking treasury funding for running a matrix homeserver? 

> [...] creation of a new chat server with cross over capability will reduce barriers in connectivity and culture

Presumably you'll still be using the rooms initially hosted in the decred.org homeserver so the ""[...] and culture"" argument doesn't make sense to me:  it's still the same rooms if the listed devs are meant to interact with the existing ones. If this is meant to _split_ the decred community chat rooms due to differing moderation style desired then I'm even _more_ against it: we're small enough as it is. You can freely create alternative rooms in the existing decred.org homeserver if you **really** wanted to (e.g. pg-general for a public chat room moderated by planet decred ppl).",31c444aefe23d06b5bc4fafcfbf110c4115c6420c2d367e089f2a07f7eaaed27b36fd5b0efc57b47aa1f311c1073a0017ce1baa6916407c2040f2635b7195909,6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686,5,1ca4ce9e8d7f578f4edb2f1832711a052a3b145cf21245cc1a15b3ff78231da3eeac61b0231164044acf00abbfbe2928429cd35d44262987492035822d60ab05,1591271725,3,3.0,False,a287e4dc-9ba1-4eee-ab1f-9dcbf90c2f82,matheusd,

Sure but all of the discussion about VSPs is not germane to this particular proposal. 

> [...] sometimes with negligent omissions.

This is a serious issue: are the blog operators _failing_ to publish relevant material that you've submitted about Decred? What _should_ be the (dare I say) ""editorial line"" of blog.decred.org?

I publish (and will continue to publish) my writings on my own page. I'm happy to write simplified stuff to syndicate on blog.decred.org if prompted. But if funding from the treasury is available for existing contractors for decred-related **blogs** then I could do the same thing. Is this a policy we wanna encourage? This is a rhetorical question of course: ultimately stakeholders will decide and this can be decided on a case-by-case basis, but I personally disagree that funding should be provided for (any) contractor-specific hosting.

Control of stuff under the decred.org domain _is_ an issue. But ultimately, the problem is that control of a specific domain is centralized in the current internet infrastructure. Let's work towards solving _that_. 

> This breaks down to $500 a month in hosting costs, and $1000 

I can definitely see dcrdata alone requiring this, but not the other things. Again, this is only ""a feel"" so I'm inclined to accept these amounts at face value unless other people with greater sysadmin experience to also comment on this. Would also be helpful to know the costs of the existing (decred.org) testnet/mainnet dcrdata instances for comparison.

> The first step towards this is to make reproducible binaries available from multiple locations

The point of reproducible binaries is to _not need multiple locations_. As long as multiple sources attest to correctness of the generated binaries (i.e. attest that the hash of a locally generated copy and the hosted binaries match), you can grab them from anywhere (even a virus-laden pirate site - but don't do this). We did this informally for 1.5.0 in the chat (devs posting the generated binaries matched among themselves) but would probably be useful (and even an interesting marketing  op) to do this _publicly_ for 1.6.0 (for example: get multiple people to record their screen building and verifying the binaries match then post on twitter/wherever under a common hashtag). It would also be useful if people other than C0 _signed_ the released binaries and posted their signatures somewhere.",53e7d3ba7b4737fd120131c33737ae78f46f3c02f5635f429e03de04635851f1cc7df7c9f7b2b04f16f15271e476aa85767a2efa59a2e881003656e0e971a00b,6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686,6,22ebe1a5f76c7bac50df4419cc4db4d234e3d2f67a4657206ccf54056ae77b07448a534b86c6784e643485a6f0bbdbc38caff011ebde5512983f22e0fa0a290d,1591276758,3,3.0,False,a287e4dc-9ba1-4eee-ab1f-9dcbf90c2f82,matheusd,

My feedback will pretty much support @matheusd's view on things:
a) I can see funds from Treasury paying for faucets, dcrdata, mixed, hosting of android / ios repos and other services which represent core infrastructure alternative. 

I think we should write down a list of all services required, publish bills for the infrastructure ran by core team and stay within ~15% budget of all parties that will run these services. 

I like the proposed period of 6 months to fund this and re-approve after that period again.

b) Running matrix, decredplanet.org, decredpower, blog .. 
I'm not in favour of paying for this work from Treasury. However I am in favour of paying Decred contractors hourly rates which are closer to market rates and give them the opportunity to fund these efforts from their earnings. 

You can also think about other ways how to raise funds for these - eg. user contributions or creating a staking pool by donors which will yield monthly profit from staking. There are so many options.

c) Local events
I'm in favour of separating all event-related aka. marketing-related activities into a separate proposal.

d) List of developers
It would be really nice to see a specific list of developers - eg. preferably their Github accounts where their work shows up.

Last note - please include the license under which the software is released. This is a note from Bee.

Decentralizing things is essential, but the idea of ​ matrix is ​​to have nodes on the network and not other rooms. It's one thing to decentralize the servers. Decentralizing the conversation makes it a little more difficult to coordinate the development. Its make more sense for events and local things.

I am not in favor of paying extra servers for our ecosystem systems as well as news pages or organizations. Imagine everyone charging for it. I have some testnet servers myself and I know we have at least 4 or 5 Testnet LNFaucets running for the public:

I wouldn't be billing the treasury for any costs associated with raedahgroup.com .    decred.org certainly has costs that go to the treasury, so why would planetdecred.org be different? Also, what is the relative cost of funding planetdecred.org compared to decred.org ?

Your reference to the last modification date is evidence of it being under-maintained, and we have a large backlog of work built up on it. This is one of the reasons we want to provide it with funding. There are indeed several UI enhancements we have in mind that we would like to see done. Particularly, as the decred economy grows, so would the number of links, so we would have to improve the user interface to make it support larger amounts of information.

I'd like to suggest a few edits to the proposal, to clarify some points to would be vuln reporters:

1. List and make it abundantly clear the payout procedure for disclosures: that to receive payment reporters need to have an account on the CMS (if that's going to be the procedure) and that they will be paid within the standard payment schedule of every other decred project and will be subject to the same limitations of both the current and the upcoming on-chain based  systems (payment in DCR only, USD/DCR conversion rate, payment delays, etc).

2. Inform _when_ payouts are released: whether it's when the _report_ is verified or if it's only after the _patch_ is written and released on a working copy.

3. Whether _all_ comms between reporter and bug bounty team should be encrypted or only the report itself or if it's up to the discretion of the bug bounty team if any encrypted comms are needed.

I'm suggesting these as direct edits to the proposal (vs a simple policy change published in the bug bounty site) so that they are, in a sense, _binding_: Specially for the first one I feel we've had some occasional uncertainty on the payout process (people not relaying their DCR address or wanting to receive on a different schedule). So putting these on the proposal itself makes it clear for both reporters and other Decred stakeholders that the bug bounty team is explicitly **not** going to ""escrow"" (for the lack of a better word) funds for reporters and that they are responsible for engaging with the standard Decred contractor systems for payouts.

Yes we are consistently reviewing and changing scope as new software is released.  Having a separate max payout and breakdown for each domain/app might be too much overhead.  When we get a vulnerability we run it through https://bounty.decred.org/img/owasp-rating.png with the network in context. 

> I really like CVEs(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and think that every security researcher wants to sign one, maybe public the bug in a CVE form to endorse better the participant, not everyone hunting just for money.

Assigning CVE's is a very resource intensive process and it has alot of centralized functions that id rather not get involved in.

We can add a SECURITY.md file which redirects to bounty.decred.org if the developers are ok with it.

These are billed at the standard contractor rates.  There is no fixed number of hours for each task (Totally depends on the number of submissions and other factors) . This is just the maximum budget for that specific task.

Please see above that.  That is the total spendings for the past year.

Here are the answers. 

>     Are bounty winners mostly one-time or are there any ""resident"" security testers?

In phase 2 all the payouts were to unique people . Phase 1 has one person get 4 small payouts (This person was the only one to get multiple payouts) . 

>    How many submissions failed to encrypt their emails? ;)

Sadly not many encrypted emails. But I am glad to say the medium level vulnerabilities that had the higher payouts (3000 USD) had all their emails encrypted. At this point if someone has encrypted their emails that usually indicates a good quality report.  

>   Did you change/optimize the process during the first two phases?

We moved from an email based payout system to the CMS. Setup standard replies https://github.com/degeri/Decred-Bug-Bounty-Proposal/tree/master/2019/email-templates

>   Did any drama/disputes occur during the first two phases?

We had a few submitters demanded a payout for duplicate vulnerabilities or sometimes refuse to accept that a vulnerability was a false positive. Usually they are ok once we explain it to them, although we has one person with whome we had to send 10+ back and forth emails.

>     Were there any cases of strong disagreement among validators?

Not had any strong disagreements IIRC.

>     Why does the last status update say 123 submissions were processed and 13 eligible for a payout, while this proposal say 60 total submissions and 4 payouts? Which numbers are real?

The website takes both phase 1 and phase 2 into account. This proposal only contains the phase 2 stats. 

>     Can you please describe submissions that were processed but turned out to be not eligible for a payout? What are most common reasons for not being eligible?

The most common reasons a submission was rejected.

Superb depth of reporting on progress so far, especially considering the csv files in the linked github version of the proposal.

I think you and the Latam team have handled the Covid-19 disruption well, pivoting to more online activity while Decred remains on the agenda for when the events which have been paid for do eventually take place. 

It's great to see the team growing and maturing. I like the plans to focus on developer recruitment and raising awareness in academia in particular.

Absolutely, we want to have a couple of research pieces translated in Spanish in the next months, there is a vast amount of research available so we will select the more relevant pieces to translate them in Spanish. We want to have a balance between general entry level information and technical resources for users looking into more advanced topics. [Decred en Español medium](https://medium.com/decred-es) is where we publish all these translations.

Such a shame you feel these ""shenanigans"" do not add value to Decred ecosystem. 

Correlating budget expenditure with social media stats only is a poor measurement of success. I'd correlate better with the engagements stated in the ""News, articles and interviews"" and ""Other mentions"" as all of them are organic and nothing was paid for them, rather we build those relations through quality content dedicated to the Spanish speaking world. 

I think we are very happy with the numbers of this [proposal ](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/3c02b677462d6d22d61bf786798e975b38df7a203c2467429d4ec91f75ef0c40) over the past past 6 months:

- 10k in surplus that will be spend in operations in 2021

- Expanded operations from Mexico and Argentina to Colombia, Uruguay, Spain, Venezuela, Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Panama.

- 38 events (IRL and virtual), 5 new local campaigns, 16 pieces of content, 16 mentions in crypto media, 10 mentions by relevant people in the crypto industry in Latam

- 5570 views on Cointelegraph in Spanish

Since it's notoriously difficult to gauge whether or not something is a ""conversion"" for a cc project because you cannot tell who is buying Decred and for what reason, I think a focus on finding developers as a deliverable would be a positive change.  The BR developers working with the project have acted as a force multiplier both in the context of achieving development milestones and spreading awareness amongst the more-technical non-developer audience, so it makes sense to emulate this configuration.

It appears that you plan to pivot to producing several videos a month for the Latam market, which is a good idea.  Can you give some detail on how you plan to produce, edit and publish these videos?  I am asking about this because I think Exitus has been doing a good job creating and editing EN video content, so I think we should attempt to emulate this success.

Liked:

- such transparency of finances should be an example for all proposals
- ""alternative finance"" - I think ""personal finance""/""alternative finance"" are huge under-explored target audiences for crypto that may help us finally break out of our echo-chamber
- ""developer headhunting"" and ""local hacking communities"" - good direction, more dev firepower never hurts
- ""connections with universities"" - another important vector. To my knowledge so far it was technical universities. I wonder how students of economics would react to the idea of fixed supply currencies.
- overall the team is very active and has achieved a lot, it makes sense to keep building on that foundation

Questions:

- How many people became Decred users over the past 6 months, based on your interactions with Latam/Spanish audience? Obviously it is a hard question, but there may be some indirect signals. For example, do you see a rise in personal trading or technical support in Spanish channels? Did any new merchants begin to accept DCR? Any new exchange integrations?
- How many people attended Latam Decred events in total (approximately)?
- Are Decred Journal translations funded from the Marketing 2019/2020 bugets or from the Latam Marketing budget? Asking because it is confusing that the [2020 one](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c830ea5afea45a0aabf4092d1bea51fb10b8bfa2d8474aac03224f0f94d3d1af) also includes DJ translations.
- Can you please comment on this ""surplus due to positive exchange rate""? Does it mean the $72K billing limit was respected, but more USD was actually acquired because at the time of conversion the rate was higher than the billing rate?
- Can you give a general idea how contractor hours were allocated? The linked gist has nice breakdowns for many expenses but not for the hours, which take roughly half of the budget.

Thanks for your comments and questions!

Regarding your queries:

- This one is a hard one. Taking into consideration a non representative sample of the Spanish speaking users, @adcade deducted that around 30% of our users have DCR, use Decrediton and consider themselves  cryptocurrency traders. If we take this information and the number of people reached during this past 6 months, we could argue (take it with a grain of salt) that around 343 people might be new DCR users. But again, this was not a representative sample in order to take conclusive data. From anecdotical experience, we have seen a steady grow of queries about DCR in social media. As per merchants, payment processors and exchange integrations, this proposal will reinforce efforts to accelerate adoption in this fronts through business development activities. 

-  After counting both IRL (420) and virtual events (722) there were a total of 1144 people directly reached by our efforts,  around 190 per month, 47 per week, 7 per day. 

- Mi mistake here, December, January, and February translations are funded with the Latam budget and March and April translations are budgeted from the Marketing  2020 proposal. 

- Exactly. Most DCR received for operations was exchanged during positive rate periods which resulted in the surplus of 10K. 

- Contractor hours are divided into the following content creation (40% of hours), business development (20%), PR (20%) and community management (20%). This is considering the month of April or May that only budgeted contractor hours and team activities. 

- Of course, there is a clarification missing in the flight expense of $4,969.15: this is for 4 returns flights Buenos Aires, Argentina to Guadalajara, Mexico and 1 return flight from La Paz, Bolivia to Guadalajara, Mexico. These 5 flights were bought for Talent Land 2020 which was postponed to April 2021 due to Covid-19, flights are now in stand by and waiting for new flying dates. As per the expense of $3,700.00, these flights are 1 return from Mexico City to Panama City ($458.54), 1 flight from Mexico City, Mexico > Caracas, Venezuela > Panama City, Panama > Madrid, Spain > Barcelona, Spain > Mexico City, Mexico ($2397.79) and a last minute flight that was purchased on March 13th due to Covid-19 borders closing, this flights is from Panama City, Panama to Mexico City, Mexico ($841.71) and subsequently, flight from Panama to Spain was put in stand by. We are expectant to see how things unfold worldwide in terms of travelling in order to select dates for the mentioned disrupted flights. 

- Indeed, I'm not contempt with numbers on Youtube. There is an area of opportunity to leverage more video format content in Spanish. I think is important to continue these efforts and now focus more energy on its distribution. I agree that numbers need to go up on this area. 

- Probably the hardest part of bringing Decred to people is the complexity and nuances of the project, people take a while to completely grasp the implications of having governance mechanisms and a treasury for development. More and more people as about fiat on ramps, at the moment is hard to bring DCR to people in 10 countries as there are not yet fiat on ramps. I think the bigger the Spanish community the more attention will come from exchanges. Furthermore, it is challenging to do organic marketing and have an exponential reach, this is the trade-off between convenience and privacy. 

Please let me know if there is any other query. 

Thanks again. Best!

Adding to elian's answer, in my experience with the public that attends meetups, the biggest challenge is in accepting something new that involves change and an effort on the part of people to use it.

Thanks for your comments! We tried to make it as comprehensive as possible, so many things happened in 6 months. Yes, Covid-19 was unexpected and forced us to change the strategy, after a couple of months working full virtual I see advantages (cheaper, exponential reach, appealing content) and disadvantages (impersonal, colder debates, lack of swag) over IRL events, we are all digital natives at Decred so it was a smooth shifting.

Thanks for the feedback! Agree that there has to be more efforts towards developer communities in Latam. We are aiming at creating more content dedicated to devs like the last webinar on [""How to fund open source software?""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVtOBAAerXk&t=5s) co-hosted by the hacking community in Peru. We receive great feedback from them and we are aiming at repeating this in other devs communities in Latam and Spain.

Regarding video production, we have iterated on several locations and formats for video content on [Decred en Español Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCprOo4gR1vsjJTAzv8BMBQ/videos), our first location was a [studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOMbJQMOcWA), then we changed to [another studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxIo17L2ipY), after Covid-19 we professionalised our software with [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com/) which allow us to livestream in different social media accounts and to increase significantly the quality of the [video production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P_Uuiq1CUQ). The work flow, in the Decred Journal recap for example,  goes from DJ  >  scripting > filming > editing > publishing. The production funnel is something that is constantly in iteration.

I'll update the team section to reflect how are we distributed.

Best!

Thanks for your question and comments. Regarding consumer adoption and the motives of people to use cryptocurrencies in Latam, there is still a long way to go and it really depends on the country you explore. 

For example in Argentina people is looking into monetary alternatives to hedge from the Argentinian peso. However, in this realm, dollars in cash are the king. More tech savvy people are looking into Bitcoin as another monetary alternative for savings (70%) and international transfers (30%). The idea of having digital dollars through DeFi products is also gaining traction in the country. Particularly in the case of Decred, users may be looking into DCR as part of a diversified portfolio (supposing they did their own research). There are several projects that are working towards time-stamping  based solutions. It is important to take in consideration that Argentina is a developer power house in the region. 

In Colombia one of the big drivers is trading and mining of cryptocurrencies. On the one hand the speculative use case of cryptocurrencies is a big driver of adoption. On the other, there is an interesting relation between Colombia and Venezuela in which Bitcoin that is mined in the Venezuelan side is sold with a discount on the Colombian side. There is usually a 10% discount in the Colombian Bitcoin market compared to the global market. 

Venezuela is one of the most advanced countries in terms of cryptocurrency awareness that I've got the chance to visit. Hyperinflation and the development of the Petro have increase the acknowledgment of Bitcoin as a monetary alternative. However, there is not the level of adoption that has been portrait to the rest of the cryptocurrency world. Moreover, as with the rest of the countries in Latam, dollars in cash are the king. 

In the case of Mexico the main driver is speculative investment and the remittance market. On the one hand, there is easy access to buy/sell/exchange cryptocurrencies so there is high demand for investment assets. On the other hand, user experiences and interfaces are still lacking the practicality for the average user to use them for international money transfers. Nonetheless, there is a growing number of start-ups that are leveraging cryptocurrencies technology to build products for the remittance market. Here is an interesting study on consumer [adoption of cryptocurrencies](https://medium.com/@entiendebitcoin/update-new-findings-distributing-bitcoin-in-latin-america-16fbb2a5f3eb) in Mexico. 

We see several use cases that are unfolding in the region:

- People escaping traditional finance systems 

- Long term investments 

- Short term investments 

- Products or services on top of Decred protocol (example is OriginalMy, we are constantly showcasing the project tech stack for entrepreneurs to use it)

- Privacy focus users, tech and finance savvy people 

- People looking into scientific knowledge

In the case of Decred's consumer adoption, there is still a long way for brand awareness and recognition, and infrastructure development for easy access to DCR. 

If we take [monetary theory](https://twitter.com/MustStopMurad/status/1022169639386836992) into consideration there is still a long way to before we get into into a consumer adoption because this would suppose that we are beyond the SoV stage and into de MoE. I would argue that there is a high degree of awareness but a low level of adoption in the form of consumer payments. 

We are looking forward to bring more details and insights into consumer adoption, there are challenges on how to measure this but this is definitely part of our goals. I think that as we see more rsolutions to buy/sell/exchange/pay with DCR there will be growing consumer adoption.

Latam market is a big bucket with many countries so the needs for crypto differ from country to country -as 3lian outlined-. Yet, the narrative boils down to a means to store wealth amidst crippling economies (turns out printing out pesos to pay dollar-based debt is terrible business) and to remittances. 

As of why our spanish-speaking community uses Decred, I was curious too, primarily to see if the narrative of SoV has really clicked here, so I ran a small survey the first two weeks of April. This quick experiment resulted -sadly- in a small amount of data for it to be considered a representation of the group, so no inductive conclusions at all.  However, if I was to share an insight from that experiment it would be this one -but take it with a grain of salt-: of my respondents, just 30 percent have Decred and they consider themselves traders within the crypto ecosystem and the Decred ecosystem and they use Decredition/Dcrwallet to store it. That is as far 
as I can go.   

And anecdotally -for what is worth- my conversations both in person and virtually all go to remittances as the #1 need here. For sure, there is an on-going exchange of currencies and crytocurrencies on a daily basis.

The book is quite complex and covers really a lot of stuff. Even Bitcoin appears for the first time in the book only in 4th chapter (out of 12). The goal of the book is to compile the whole story of cryptocurrencies, explain how things evolved in the context, and provide the reader with hints where to look further. Therefore, there is not much space to elaborate on each project into detail as there are many dozens of them mentioned in the book. 

 I do write about DCR in the Altcoin section in terms of its consensus algorithm, and I actually wanted to write about it more in the part focused on governance where I wanted to describe how cool is that even this book could get funded via treasury in a decentralized manner. I understand that you don't see the ""necessity"" to fund it. I do write this book for the cryptocurrency community, and want to make it accessible as much as possible (maybe at some point release it for free completely, but not sure yet ), so I can't imagine a better or more understanding audience than crypto tribes such as Decred community.  

As mentioned in the proposal, yes the decision to (not)fund the book does not impact the content of the book. 

As per other sponsors, I just started to reach out to companies and communities so there is none confirmed but I am in talks with multiple projects, I don't wanna give names as I don't feel it is polite, but they include Bitcoin ATM companies, Smart contract platforms, DeFi Apps, or other altcoin communities. 

As you can imagine this kind of book is not a profitable endeavor, and all I wanted to do is to raise funds from the crypto community, to cover the costs to release it, and potentially fund translations to other languages.

I'm not familiar with the kind of costs you would incur in publishing a book, is $1,000 a significant proportion or would you still need to raise much more from other sources?

I have written a book of sorts myself ([cryptocommons.cc](https://cryptocommons.cc)) which was funded in part by the Decred Treasury through the Open Source Research Program (there are some details in the last [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/e3675649075a2f92269d8cdc2e1dfd71b16796477df31de7d2868cccfcffb13f)). I released Peer Production on the Crypto Commons under a creative commons license and made the [site](https://github.com/block-commons/cryptocommons) open source, partly because I felt that was in keeping with the spirit of the Decred [Constitution](https://docs.decred.org/governance/decred-constitution/) which stipulates that all software developed as part of the project should be Free and Open-Source Software. 

I guess you could argue that books don't count as software, probably quite successfully, but I would not personally be inclined to approve any proposal which is about funding the development of copyrighted content where the proposal owner retains exclusive rights to distribute that content.

This is interesting and I like the idea of the exposure, however, $1000 is too high of an ask, I am even not convinced of $500 to be honest (it is a drain on the treasury during a bear market with depressed prices). Given this would be a nominal donation, the Treasury is essentially speculating on awareness raised by this book (and thus speculating on the the success of the book). 

If I return to an objective, Best for Decred position, I suggest that for the Treasury to consider speculating on such an  outcome requires explicit content related to why Decred's donation is very different to that of a VC backed DeFi product. What I would propose is that a section in the book describing how the treasury model works and in fact even making reference this proposal process.

#### Liked

- The topic is important, it is good to educate people where cryptocurrencies are coming from, and hopefully where they are going to.
- The linked articles about pre-Bitcoin [history](https://www.aaro.capital/Article?ID=Before%20Bitcoin:%20A%20History%20of%20Digital%20Currencies) and [tokenization](https://www.aaro.capital/Article?ID=d877655f-262d-47dd-a2ee-06ff70f614f7) read well (but please don't link through the tracking link shortener middlemen).
- I have read a few random pages from the linked [sample chapters](https://www.stanceldavid.sk/book/) and quite liked it, the text is interesting and easy to read. I would personally read such a book.

#### Issues and concerns

I don't like the idea to sponsor a book that will not be fully free and open source since its inception. The main motivation for me to support such proposal would be to maximize the reach of the message about cryptocurrencies and Decred. The problem is, the idea that there is a robust solution to a broken fiat system is somehow still not popular, 11 years since the launch of Bitcoin and after two global financial crises. Any attempts to hold the ""ownership"" of information and make an extra buck further suppress the spread of already unpopular message.

When an author makes content freely available it is a proof that he is more interested in sharing his knowledge rather than making profit or building his brand. A free book would also attract more contributions to improve it, further reinforcing its distribution. Look at the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. It is fully open yet it is extremely popular.

In general we have a strong preference for open-sourced deliverables that are funded by the Treasury. ""Decred has sponsored a free and open-sourced book"" reads much better than ""Decred has sponsored a non-free copyrighted book"". Personally I would rather vote for a bigger budget but one that funds a free book.

Sadly I'm late with this comment now that the vote has been authorized and no edits are possible (I think).

Making the printed version available for purhcase for DCR would be very nice.

#### Notes

Because it answered some of my questions, copying some info from the linked May 2020 [sponsorship proposal](https://www.stanceldavid.sk/book/) document (which was last updated May 20):

- fundraising goal: EUR 12K for book editing, design, formatting, and publishing (printed 1,500 pieces)
- length: 70K-85K words (around 330 pages)
- audience: business professionals, crypto community, IT crowd
- current status: 3/4 of the book is finished
- expected publishing date: June 2020
- the doc outlines marketing strategies to promote the book, including publishing some chapters for free, conference talks, podcasts, newsletter, crypto puzzle, social media content, sending free copies to selected influencers and selected educational institutions.

- How many pages the book is estimated to have and how many are already written (did it change since the original sponsorship proposal)?
- How many pages will be dedicated to Decred?
- How many pages will be dedicated to topics relevant for Decred such as sound money, governance, funding, skin in the game, giving the final say to those most exposed vs creating a yet another system where control is delegated to some group (e.g. miners), etc? (Decred [iterates](https://blog.companyzero.com/2015/12/iterating-bitcoin/) Bitcoin in a big way and addresses its biggest [challenges](https://blog.companyzero.com/2015/11/bitcoins-biggest-challenges/))
- To what extent the book talks about monetary policies, how fiat money printing is extracting value from the population, separating money from the state, and what triggered the creation of Bitcoin? In other words, to what extent the book conveys the spirit and goals of the cryptocurrency movement vs providing a historical reference?
- Is it possible to include an interview with a Decred community member?
- How technical the reader must be?
- Have you published a book before?",baf49cc06a34da4679333cc7731f03088831fce07c6ee166912852d219809eea9ee4120cc5c33e8ba5fa3dce61656a518efdf1ded1c85cc10fa9b5034a4c590d,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,22,cef454907c41f920860d5c76d96a339d7ae0f02154fb18370d013125e9c421b80954a31b0524413230256ab27367912bfb764460fdf45c01e1a1f8100cec6302,1590862755,2,2.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

I haven't made my final decision yet. But at this point, I am leaning towards that option like 85% because I would like to reach the point when it would be updated by different crypto communities. 

Regarding your other questions:
- I guess the approximate length will be 300 pages (still depends on the feedback from my alpha readers and editor) I estimate that content will be ready be and of June. 
- Given that I am trying to summarize the whole crypto history in 300 pages, I won 't go into details of many altcoins, my goal is to mention their key distinct features to and let the reader then decide which one she wants to explore more. Thus, DCR would be mentioned roughly on a half-page. 
- I am not focusing that much on monetary theories in the context of fiat, as I believe there are enough resources and books that elaborate on that. Still, as the book contains lots of quotes from different crypto builders and thinkers, including Cypherpunks, I believe it explores their narratives and conveys the message of why cryptocurrencies were created. 
- I would be happy do an interview with a Decred community member, even though I don't think I will manage to include it in the book. I want to go on with interviews also after the book is finished at Medium: [https://medium.com/coin-story](url). 
- I believe the book requires some pre-existing knowledge of the crypto space as I don't aim to explain all the concept into detail as , again, there are lots of great resources doing just that.
- No, I have not published the book before. This whole thing is for me a huge experiment. I probably make lots of mistakes along the way. Therefore, I am very grateful for any feedback.

That would be a power move :) If you go that route, one idea I have is to make sure that people have easy ways to support you: Patreon, Liberapay, crypto addresses for donations, etc.

Understood. In context of history, I would mention the most important historical events and achievements for Decred (often underrated in the crypto space), such as self-funded launch without ICO and a transparent premine+airdrop, first holder-activated hard fork to change consensus in a way miners not necessarily liked, release of atomic swap tools and early swaps with LTC, Politeia launch, privacy launch, etc - see timeline [here](https://decred.org/history/).

If the airtime has already been allotted, why are you asking for money?  Did the T.V. Networks run out of money?  Did the budget shrink?


> The TV networks have cleared Decred (DCR) to do a 2 or 6 part featured T.V. series.

If it's cleared, then why are you asking for money?

If the TV networks find Decred valuable enough to present to 1096.7M households (by this proposal's numbers), then why isn't the Decred Treasury the one getting paid for educating 1096.7M of your audience, and making you appear educated on blockchain? At a conservative $1-$10 per user impression, this will cost the TV networks $1B+.  And you dare ask for money?  Huh.


> Furthermore, the Decred project qualifies for (DCR) token/coin payment and all cash compensation has been waived.

This is intentionally misleading, and isn't far from psychological warfare.  You're presenting the phrase ""compensation has been waived"" as if some fee has been waived, to mask asking for money.  I don't appreciate it.

It's not very smart either.  The TV Networks have the potential to ensure 1096.7 households learn about decentralized cryptocurrencies like Decred *from the TV Networks* instead of friends.   ""How come the TV never said anything,"" everyone will ask.   What a colossal mistake it would be to let that emotional connection slip.  It could easily be the defining mistake this generation of TV Network executives later become famous for.  If you want to blow it by asking for money, go right ahead.

While I see potential in TV marketing, I'm skeptical that this particular proposal is serious. I have a lot to say, but before I spend any more time let me ask you two short questions:

> This T.V. exposure has the potential to increase: Market cap: (+731%), Daily trade volume: (+632%), Token price: (+901%)

1. Focusing on price increase is odd, but let's put that aside for a moment. Let's imagine we want to invest into TV marketing with an explicit goal to pump DCR/USD, we are serious about it and we are ready to pay good money. What is your guarantee that any increase will be achieved? Will you return the money back if DCR/USD will not increase e.g. by a modest +100% over the next 90 days?

We have never had sponsored ads on our show. But maybe you can work something out with a company that wants to pay Decred to mention them on TV.

In Marketing repetition and placement is very important. Ideally, you want to be everywhere. Although YouTube and Facebook are very targeted advertising tools, nothing compares to TV. TV is very powerful and has the institutional level of exposure YouTube and Facebook simply don't have. I have never ran a Facebook or Youtube ad that made the market cap of the company go up as much as our TV show broadcasts do. 

We have institutional investors who follow our program and based on the [NativeCoin (N8V) Case study](https://w3bt.io/case-studies-testimonials/tv-marketing/), that should be proof enough that TV exposure makes a huge difference.

We have been doing this for blockchain companies for about 3 years and publicly traded companies for over 10 years.

The challenge is to find people who would listen, because it looks like most people still have faith in fiat and believe it would magically fix itself. It is almost useless to explain crypto to people who are not ready.

Another challenge is to explain how Decred works because it is a complex system.

Finally, there is a simple idea at the core of Decred that is hard to explain because it is an unpopular idea: to have a system that serves _you_, you have to take responsibility and actively participate in its governance.

I personally am doing my very best to draw as much attention to the project as do what I can with my skillset. It takes alot of time and effort to develop these tools, which you may not find useful, but alot of people in the community seem to. As you can see, I did not add any billable items for my part in this project, it is purely for the web-dev and designers. In fact, on a non-billable to billable ratio in my own work, I probably only bill 30% of the time I spend working on Decred material to the treasury. I find myself on 1-2 podcasts per week, build community videos and meetups, post research on socials, discuss ideas on Matrix, write code for these charts and deliver the Our Network newsletter once a month --> All non billed, free, zero cost, all paid for out of my own time because I want to deliver good work for the project. In fact I spend so much time on non-billable Decred work, I am struggling to spend my budget because i'm overloaded. Do with that what you will.

I'm wondering if you have any further thoughts around how you imagine traders will use these metrics. When I first joined the project, I totally had ideas of finding alpha in understanding Decred's unique ticket system, on-chain activity. I never got around to it, primarily due to barriers such as lack of data at the time (DCR had only recently launched on Binance and historical data was scarce), high slippage, and lack of infrastructure (at the time) to run bots written in python. Do you know of any traders already trading Decred with bots? Are they running into similar barriers I did? Can you speculate on the probability of traders using these metrics, and the avenues they would take (aside from traders in #trading using TA that presumably already use your stuff)?

Even if the charts aren't actively used by traders, I think this is worth the cost. For current and future data-driven investors, general education, and premium ""top of the funnel"" content pulling people into the project--I distinctly remember Permabull Nino's articles being particularly fascinating when I was first going down the Decred rabbit hole, and it reflected well on the project that someone would be doing such deep, interesting analysis of the project.

Regarding traders, I personally use many onchain metrics for Bitcoin especially to identify high value entry exits but I am a longer term thinker. Many firms and funds absolutely use these signals for trading and setting macro bias and whilst I do not have personal contacts, I do follow the discussions on socials and private chat rooms. These types of metrics certainly get a look in and I am excited to see once live, people sharing and using the tools. The likes of glassnode et al certainly get snipped and shared by high quality traders for BTC on the regular and I believe this is just another cog in that infrastructure machine dedicated to Decred.

I agree, the quality of research from Zubair, Nino and others added a layer of quality that really shaped my original Decred dive.

Would like to see the DCR metrics and innovation reach other than 100-people on TWTR and 2.5K on TG,

I'm not saying the content of these Medium publications are value-less; but I am expressing my frustration behind how the funds of Treasury seem to be yielding MINIMAL ROI metrics with regard to adoption and awareness - continuously funding fruitless research (which we all consume) but not considering that precious info never even reaches the VAST crevices of the crypto ecosystem - in my opinion rhymes with working harder than working smarter...

I believe that to win a big crowd we need to win a bunch of small communities first. Roughly speaking:

1. Never forget that we build a _currency_, which is SoV and MoE, and _focus_ on that in our dev work (reliable and secure software with smooth UX) and outreach (message and targeting).
2. Use DCR as _currency_ within our community. Contractors already do it by getting their paychecks in DCR. Extend that to receiving and sending tips and donations, fund small projects outside Politeia, sell your paintings for DCR like [@AGNFAB](https://twitter.com/AGNFAB1) does, etc.
3. Train [ambassadors](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/48) and bring the message about this amazing currency to [real people](https://xaur.github.io/writings/posts/20191127-marketing-strategies.html#reach-people-to-whom-it-really-matters) who are tired of the existing system and are ready to try a better one.

It triggered a lot of thought so adding a summary first:

- Looks good overall!
- Please clarify on the openness of deliverables, privacy of the site when it goes live, and some techical aspects.
- I'm not a fan of pleasing ""traders"" and ""investor"" audiences, at least not now. Instead I'd like to target people who deeply care about Decred's mission and principles (in the short term) and ""arbitrary SoV and MoE"" users in the mid-long-term.

Long version below.

#### Questions

Openness of deliverables:

- Will the datasets generated by OnChain be openly available? If yes, in what form?
  - Visualization is great, but having raw data is great too. It would support two use cases: other researchers could download and play with the data permissionlessly, and in case the site goes down/censored other people would have all necessary data to re-deploy it elsewhere.
  - For example, I [requested](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrextdata/issues/187) this in dcrextdata but it seems to have no easy data download or an API. It is harder to add later if you don't plan for it.
  - Here's a [prototype](https://github.com/xaur/social-media-data) showing how open data could look like and explaining the approach. The storage format is unusual and I'm sure it can be greatly improved, the PoC serves to show the principles.
- What license or license family will the source code use?

Development - code reuse. I'm interested in minimizing the initial dev costs by reusing code whenever possible and future maintenance costs by not having the same thing done twice. In that regard:

- We have quite a few charts implemented with the web stack by now: dcrdata, Decrediton, [dcrextdata](http://dcrextdata.planetdecred.org/) and soon dcrdex. Will OnChain reuse any of that code or build all from scratch?
- Will OnChain reuse any code or APIs from dcrdata? If yes, which?
- Will this require developing any missing features in dcrdata?
- I understand the idea to not distract dcrdata/dcrdex devs for integrating new metrics into dcrdata, but did you consider forking dcrdata and build on top of it? It has storage, backend, websockets, charting, etc all figured out.

Development - content management. Implementing ""research blogs"" requires a content management and publishing system. One such system for collectinve blogging we have is Hugo-based [blockcommons.red](https://blockcommons.red/), which has very desirable properties of open source code and open content (Markdown texts and images stored in Git). Questions:

- Did you consider simply publishing research blogs at blockcommons.red?
- If not, what is the motivation to implement a separate platform?
- How do you plan to implement it? Here I'm most interested in raw content being openly accessible and easy to clone (Git) vs paying for yet another closed easy-to-die database like [decredcommunity.org](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83).

Development - other:

- Is there anything more specific than ""X years of experience"" and ""worked on project X"" for Pavel's development background?
- Can someone share an outline of the tech stack and high level approach to be used? e.g. how will you store data on the backend, how will you cache it on the client, how will you make the charts fast (a known pain point in dcrdata)? I'd like to feel that the dev side of this project is in a good architect's hands.

Operations and privacy:

- Is operating the site included in the costs? If yes, for how long and what is the monthly cost?
- Who will ""own"" site administration?
- What data will the site collect from visitors? Please expand ""anonymized analytics"".
- What invasive/tracking third parties will the site use? Will it include any third party scripts or fonts? Google reCAPTCHA? Will it take an ""easy route"" and hide behind Cloudflare (which is becoming a single point of failure and surveillance for the whole Internet)?
  - I prefer websites that don't require any 3rd party requests and don't share their visitor data with _any_ third parties. It would be awkward to pay from Treasury for feeding surveillance companies the data of people interested in Decred. decred.org made active efforts to not do it.
- Please elaborate what do you mean by ""Deployed with same standard as official Decred websites"".
- Does this proposal include any content generation work like blogs, educational documents or videos, to be published on the site?

Features:

- Will there be a public API that researchers could query from their programs? (note that this is different from downloading an entire dataset)
- Does ""DCR/USD volatility index"" fit into this project? I would like us to start including ""Decred as money"" users into the target audience of our messages and products. We keep avoiding them and focusing on investors and speculators, while ""electronic cash"" is the reason why crypto was started at all.

I would appreciate if you could clarify any items asked above in the proposal document before it is ""signed"" by the stakeholders.",72f3f5041b7a31f947eead2277fa36a5faa88b6b5ceac123d155ac980be9243031b9d8c3a0bd93924b01ff288999339fa852c6947da3fe29b4b87bbb08b21602,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,54,6d039528022abd7de935ca97502af892609ac90181c33850eff161ddca303d5608efa1e6cb080a892c091c77090b1eee1d8b928a003ab1fd5910fa0a32aafb03,1590355858,3,3.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

#### What I like

- It is beneficial for stakeholders to obtain software and content database that will make all the knowledge and insights discovered by our on-chain researchers so far preserved and made much more accessible via live data visualization. I'm getting less optimistic about spending on work that is not building our core products and that is not directly onboarding users (e.g. a possible ""Decred Ambassadors"" program). But it's not an issue for this proposal because I expect this product to be a good intelligence tool for informing stakeholders and for getting new people interested. I think this has more value compared to blog posts. Not because our researchers write bad posts, but because all our content gets very little views. Interactive and discoverable charts are fun and I expect that they will engage more people and yield images shared by people inside and outside of the Decred community.
- Most team members have good track record of contributing to Decred and I'm confident about their skills. I'm not too familiar with Pavel and Stan yet, but since Checkmate will be responsible for overall delivery (I assume based on his ownership of this prop) it is less of an issue for me. Although it would be nice if they can chime in and say a few words about their background/vision/approach/plans for working on this project.
- Proposing team sounds enthusiastic to bring it to completion.
- Dual language support will force to lay the translation infrastructure into the foundation, vs hacking it in as an afterthought.
- Price is good.

#### Concerns and dislikes

- If the ""Dark Mode"" is anything but trivial and very cheap, it should be out of scope for this MVP and could go in a follow-up proposal. It's good to plan for in the UI code though.
- Amount of work might be underestimated.

Speaking of target audience, OnChain will serve everyone but I'd like to comment on the audiences pitched in this proposal:

- This proposal mentions traders 5 times - even more than investors. I don't want to pay for helping traders get an edge. They are not building Decred, not doing ambassador work, not using DCR for SoV and MoE. Further, if their mode of operation is not ""minimize spreads, minimize volatility, maximize liquidity"" (which is a [useful service](https://xaur.github.io/writings/posts/20190822-dissection-market-makers-for-decred.html#1-market-maker-is-doing-useful-work) done by liquidity providers), but ""extract profits from people who exchange for _real_, bigger spreads is good, more volatility is good"", then I'm strongly against feeding them with our precious and limited resources (on top of their existing profits).
- I also don't see why we should explicitly care for ""institutional investors"" or treat them specially. I don't want to pay for pitching to hedge funds or anything like that. Not now at least. At this stage I'd like to invest in collecting more loyal early adopters and builders whose values are deeply aligned with Decred and who will not jump ship on next trouble.

Imagine that DCR collapses to $1. How many ""institutional investors"" and ""traders"" will quietly exit before the general public, and how many will stay with us to actually build the SoV/MoE/DAO? Mid-long term when Decred gets stronger I'd like to actively target arbitrary ""SoV and MoE users"" without any further specialization - people who want to _transition_ from an old broken system to a new better system, instead of squeezing more USD from their investement asap.

#### Ideas

- ""Save chart as PNG"" feature to help people share charts on the web. This will save time compared to making and cropping the screenshot manually.
- Embeddable chart widget. Motivation is same as above. Maybe not in the initial release, but it's good to keep in mind when writing UI code and planning the API.
- If you're after exposing the overall ""health"" of the network, consider presenting important off-chain metrics like node count, hashrate, trading volumes, amount of active GitHub contributors, etc, and/or incorporating them into derived metrics.
- ""Decred OnChain"" does not reflect that the site will also take off-chain data into account. A bit more generic title like ""Decred Metrics"" would capture that. It's not a big deal though, and ""Decred OnChain"" is a good-looking title.

1. Datasets are all generated via aggregating coinmetrics + dcrdata apis. All code is open source and already written, as are the calculations. I would also like a csv download option and this can be built in (either this iteration or the next). All code for charts in in python on my github
2. Research blogs - blockcommons is focused on governance aspects, this will be data driven. Different field, different aesthetic, different site
3. Dev and Privacy - I will leave for Pavel to answer.
4. Features - yes we can build volatility metrics. The reason for this site is we can go down any data driven path we choose. Dark mode is already coded into the chart suite and design has taken this into consideration. It could be something pushed to a later phase if required and just install the bones now.
5. Investors and Traders - These are people, stakeholders and market participants like everyone else. They all operate on quality information. Flip this around the other way, if no investor or trader uses our data, then it is not worth much. We cannot influence who enters or exits, we simply aim to provide the highest quality data and research for anyone to use. They are a target audience because they are everyone who touches the asset as an investment.
6. Ideas - PNG is available for plotly, the charting package, embedded charts is a good one, there is no limit to what metrics we display, limited only by our creativity.

Improving data visualization has been discussed a few times in the past since the research work has picked up, though nobody has yet followed up on this. So all in all I’m supportive of this proposal as I think this should greatly benefit all research efforts. Providing some bits of feedback:

- On the UX side, the benchmarked sites are solid examples. The design drivers for meeting the listed objectives should likely be around the quality of presenting the research data, both in terms of what the experience of working with a single chart/research piece and its drawn components is like; as well navigating (and managing) an always scaling archive of research. 
- Reviewing the wireframes, on quick glance there's quite a lot going on there in terms of details which draws away from the focus as well notably  ""stakeholders vs investors"" macro tags seem like an obscure way to base the structure off. Unless there’s good reasoning behind it, I’d consider basing that off simpler and more traditional structure or keep it intentionally undefined and simpler until good reasoning can be worked out (e.g. based on the actual content populating the site). 
- As this seems very much like an MVP in nature,  I would recommend to ditch the dark and light mode + language support and put that time on purely working out a better UX – whether it's by doing more research to build up understanding on the use cases; doing validations with other contributors and leaving time for iterating and experimenting where needed.   
- There are no concrete details on how this project will be maintained or followed up on, besides additional feature ideas. Correct me if I’m wrong but just maintaining it should be a chunk of regular work? 
- On the components – I’d recommend working with the piui https://decred.github.io/pi-ui/, as there’s also a bit of relevant work done on the dcrdata regarding various charting components, taking into account accessibility on color blindness, etc. https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/139 . My understanding is that the piui is the furthest developed of the different dcr gui’s, and there's attention and active work on expanding its use and improving it, ie. implementation to decrediton. Makes sense to base work off that, as in that way you'd also contribute to growing the ui and design assets for common use.
 
Whereas I think the pricing for the scope of work is fine for the delivery, I find it problematic the way the hourly breakdowns and the team are presented. On the UX side, half of the items have a 3x variation range. Comparing with the dev work, which has no breakdown or descriptions of the work being made. This gives off a lot of uncertainty. Imo its fine to serve a pricing either as a fixed, value based, hourly or other methods, but either way should be done a bit more clarity. 

Regarding designers and front-end devs, there's no portfolios or case studies. Even a small portfolio of at least some 3-5 case studies on relevant and successful projects, which one can proudly stand next to, will tell a lot about the match and competence. Listing years of experience / unnamed project with big numbers / illustration work while proposing to work on ux and data vis. only leaves the reviewer a vague assumptions. Don't take this as anything dramatic though, the critique is meant to root a better practice for design matters in proposals.",a65ebbed2c5c56f669c9e6658ce6cf0174c870bc671e70c91b0a4fe99e47e7543d23769131ecc3e88762538fab430f749c17bdb353e70cf3361d18036566ae0f,db0979d1b10a1180ceb3bc497132a98ea3d40ecbac1d2b8a1ab687039721146c,61,115f2c843663adc9468a12454b0551b6b373d684c9ff1d0a29847caa16b377c291adbae51823037f7eb432ccd7d6870e1f06d6bf76e6d368e1df467efd75a702,1590413201,4,4.0,False,ba96e181-abff-4c1a-b2be-9bb916ea4083,linnutee,

I am not the smartest person and we are not the smartest community. We can and will make some bad collective decisions and face the consequences. Today's society stimulates individuals to _not_ think independently and to _not_ exercise their sovereignty as much as possible. Since we were raised in it, we got used to avoid active participation in systems where we have no voice. It is natural that when we finally join such a system we will make mistakes at first. I'm optimistic that we can all learn from it. Personally, I would not vote yes again for some things I voted yes in the past, but I could not learn it sooner than I did.

> I am considering new proposals not from the point of view of utility (this is how to try to look into the future), but from the point of view whether this should be financed from the treasury.

Very generous, thank you.

> we want to know at least country stats, how people move on the website and where do they go from there would be great for additional insights

The decent way to do analytics in my opinion is ""first party"", where my client talks to your server and that's it, we do not let anybody else in our ""relationship"". Your server can map my IP to a country and inspect my HTTP Referer header because your server sees them anyway.

Tracking outgoing links in general is a bit more tricky as it requires messing with plain HTML links in one way or another to sniff where the user is heading. I'm not a fan of that as a user but it is much better than injecting 3rd party tracking scripts in both source and destination.

> We DO NOT want to collect IP addresses or any other PII

I would prefer if _you_ collected my IP vs injecting some Google spy code to help _them_ collect my IP (and much, much more), give you only a fraction of the data they collected, and then monetize/abuse the data to the best of their ability.

As a middle ground you can map IP to country on the fly and not log it at all.

> I am happy to share the access with code devs responsible for current official website

If you plan to deploy the site as a subdomain of decred.org that makes sense. If not, keep in mind that quite a lot of stuff is already centralized around ""core devs"" and it would be good to reduce centralization not increase it.

The reason I asked about admin ownership was purely ""stakeholder investment"" perspective. I would like the site to keep running with maximum uptime with minimum ""admin vanished"" risk. Ideally, there should be 1-2 ""fallback"" people who can admin/fix the site in case the main admin is unable to.",7732395871bd1460e112f4e51bcb694d0c0e86a04c6339856d6a80511458b8ee0e2f8456e7558f31f612e5909d3b094310bff2e3587d5fa8f53d0432b49c980e,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,66,1e067343ef2278c760c6cddb90eeda671870f223afa460a91d738098cf7b595941414754aa6cf399ec3a117bf9450730b59bb494ee679ed971215e8317a47804,1590621974,3,3.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

Big Fan of your research and the community is grateful for the Phase 1 contributions - constructive and helpful. 
While I would happily support your next proposal for Phase 2 contributions - would like to highlight the need to for analysis with regard to mining PoW data. 

This analysis below is the sole reason I would support the proposal (below)

More time analyzing mining data (block rewards, fees, hashrate, difficulty, block times), as phase 1 was very heavy on the ticket data analysis
Exploration of storage metrics (blockchain size, as an example)

Charts on capitulation speculation, historical BTC/DCR synopsis, and an economic index ? - Price-related charts are publicly available on trading view and exchanges. 

Not certain how an economic index will drive user adoption and enhance utility and further drive DCR's vision of attaining SoV. 

Because tone cannot be inferred over the internet, would like to reiterate I am sincerely grateful again for your contributions thus far, but to summarize a great deal of JYP's innovative developments with DCR (from recent Consensus stream) - 

1) LN integration 
2) Decrediton Privacy implementation (moving away from just CL) 
3) Schnorr 
4) DEX development 

The above are CONCRETE use-cases being integrated into the DCR project and are creating opportunities to onboard new users and demonstrate conviction in the long term validity of DCR. Enhanced utility will drive appreciation and push Decred to the front of the stage in this ecosystem.. 

On-Chain fundamental analysis, speculation and even analytics are helpful to gain insight into the project but current participants in DCR  passively observe from the sidelines and I only worry that the more time and DCR we invest as whole into massaging data to demonstrate value vs. rolling up sleeves, innovating and pushing commits and revolutionary tech will delay Decred's public awareness. 

Further and ongoing analysis on a Balance Sheet of a company would be filed under R & D in my opinion and I would like to catalyze more innovation to onboard more community members.. I personally feel R & D investments should have a positive return and if we're measuring ROI in terms of DCR appreciation - $, SATS, or additional users/participants - I am struggling to see the return the project needs w/ regard to additional on-chain vs. Genuine Innovation (DEX, LN integration, Schnorr, Privacy CoinShuffle ++ ) 

Thank you again for all your contributions

- Some people are not seeing the value in the research - and it seems that a big part of this is related to the fact that the tools haven't been readily available for stakeholders. Hopefully concerns on that front are cleared up with [Checkmate's most recent proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/023091831f6434f743f3a317aacf8c73a123b30d758db854a2f294c0b3341bcc) to bring an on-chain landing page to Decred.

- Outside of Bitcoin, there are few (if any) projects that have coherent on-chain data the way Decred does. As newly emerging monies, I believe on-chain data analysis is not only valuable for trading (what it's usually associated with), but also in studying how stakeholders engage with their money, which (as Checkmate has mentioned) can better inform governance decisions in the future. 

- Agree with me or not, there's value in proving how elegant the on-chain data prints are for Decred. As somebody who spends a lot of time looking at this stuff, it is a strong way to separate the real cryptocurrencies and the pretenders. We might be on the early side of this, but smart people do and will find value in the work that's been completed to date.

- Decred still hasn't left the bear market behind, so naturally everyone is a bit concerned about treasury spends (totally understandable). But this is why I designed the proposal as it is, and especially the portion focused on the medium-length deliverables - I want to churn out analysis at the most cost efficient way possible for the treasury. Tools that stakeholders will be able to use for a long time, and will hopefully aid them in better understanding the unique economy they've opted into.

- Overall, maybe your mind is already made up anyways, but figured this might at a minimum give you greater comfort in the ask I have proposed to the community",f852d3c4ee25bbd520f9d9d628de5a2c954f464fa1168462c88e78e32c98ebffc5458ae4bd43b6102d622dd4bf1892f3b68bc06bb1fa5f8de134bc8b82136701,8f9fa531b543c6e0b805a1abcc858400f8316cd937785c40e36f4d05171e83b5,13,b0567e2a72d92dd5617fbd10682eda04f8e1343427c820ae9aa5c4fd5b5b8a6e2f15f05e4c59859c925185d5fbf565227b57098376f4232af31656e25337b009,1589860026,6,6.0,False,2d14fd6f-b0b6-4dc1-9bfa-4d6d5793da27,permabullnino,

I believe very few projects understand their chain performance as well as Nino, and by proxy Decred's stakeholders and this will have lasting influence.

At its core, the analysis Nino has performed provides three key parties with invaluable information which I believe benefits the project both today and into the future:
- Stakeholders - by providing clear distilled information, governance can be as best informed as possible (this also includes miners and I very much welcome further research into this market)
- Long term investors (both retail and institutional) - providing detailed fundamental analysis as expressed through actual performance
- Short term traders - providing actionable trading signals which once live on a website (proposal coming soon) will hopefully can be a draw for additional liquidity

- When I talk about research on DCR capitulation, I'm talking about the on-chain footprint that's been scattered across the various stakeholder groups, not an analysis of the DCR/BTC chart. Decred has never gone a full market cycle before so this information would (in my opinion) be extremely valuable for stakeholders, and will likely come with tools that can used again in the future

- The economic index was just an idea, and would be some sort of composite score across various DCR on-chain tools. Given the nature of the tool, wouldn't be expensive *if* it was done (and it actually worked of course). If people don't like this idea, happy to scrap it , not something I'm married to by any means

- I agree that dev work and funding it is of utmost importance for Decred. However, there is value in funding other work to complement theirs - no team has ever won a championship without contributions from role players, and my goal with this proposal is to continue in a supporting role

Now for a few nerdy accounting takes on the proposed / previous work:

- These publications / research are not ""expenses"", they're assets. What comes from the research can be used by stakeholders all across the board for the forseeable future (and in a variety of ways), and the cumulative value that comes from that would be how I'd measure ROI personally. Expecting on-chain research to pump price is a tall task unfortunately. So the fairer question would be: does the cumulative value over the months / years from these tools surpass the $16k spent through 2020? If the answer in your eyes is still no, then I certainly consider it fair to vote against the proposal.

- When I worked in audit, we had a saying that went ""if you didn't document it, it didn't happen"". I view my job as an on-chain analyst as a role in documentation, and by doing so providing not only (1) greater visibility to those outside the project, but (2) further assurance on what's going on within the Decred economy.

- Last point: I know funding Decred research is valuable because I am a customer of it from day 1. Richard Red's extensive write ups helped bolster my understanding and hook me in during my early Decred days (along with Zubair Zia's work). I'm sure I'm not the only one with this story",b469945dc794194523830e7d26bbd599586818258a5e47e2c1c5d2b33fe9f30d4d1e3ceb1adc119e8296d1ef9c2539e5979c34e23d41344b79f6878f59c04909,8f9fa531b543c6e0b805a1abcc858400f8316cd937785c40e36f4d05171e83b5,5,4e2d1d7879804a20a62f494ea93eaa62b099256f2f0cfbdca9466f14871c39ca7709cf207705ec112208e6de3cd4d95d9a11d8a5625a0e87c318989a65ae2e06,1589471438,5,5.0,False,2d14fd6f-b0b6-4dc1-9bfa-4d6d5793da27,permabullnino,

> ""Economic` Index"" - a composite score ? .. again, I am struggling to see the utility to the network/community in having a potential tool ""that might or might not work"" that DCR community members have to contribute funds toward supporting ?

Something we agree on - ***""I agree that dev work and funding it is of utmost importance for Decred.""  ***

You argue there is value in funding other work that is **complimentary** - can you quantify the value your research has yielded? 
How are your publications driving user adoption, awareness, and interaction.. you have 2400+ followers on TWTR; how can your publications reach 10,000 - 100,000 (are you tweeting the publications to prominent figures) ?

You maintain the stance - your research is filed as an ASSET. How do we quantify that ? 
Value to stakeholders is too vague & qualitative.. as ticket-holders and community participants, we deserve to see ROI on roughly - 1150 DCR or $16,000.. what is it ?

I don't expect on-chain publications (IF THE AUTHOR'S PLATFORM is limited to 2.4K followers on TWTR) to pump price ..

How do we get Permabull Nino or _Checkmate_ to share on chain fundamentals w/ @POMP or Andreas or Coinbase CEO - Brian Armstrong, or Jesse Powell - Kraken CEO or Jack Dorsey ?

Decred Project is a few business quarters away from Innovative Explosion and 1150 DCR/$USD could be VERY valuable to the community and Treasury for future ventures.
While it's $16,000 currently - it could be $100,000+ in near future if the intrinsic value of this network reaches mainstream.. 

All I'm asking and imploring the community to ask - WHAT IS THE QUANTITATIVE ROI on further On-Chain metric research papers if the publications continue to fly under the radar or don't reach the audience that needs to access this data ? If ur a stakeholder through this brutal bear market/SAT/$USD - you have a rough understanding of Stake Pool metrics.. how do we reach the rest of the World ?

Appreciate Everyone's contributions and efforts and welcome constructive feedback, 

Thank you

Many people, both retail, institutions and traders will be looking at this space as it gains increasing momentum. We are all here because we believe this technology and in particular Decred stand to benefit the world in almost immeasurable ways. Providing clear, concise and well considered research will attract attention as we leave the bear. The alternative is you have a bunch of ill informed or automated hype machines with no substance. I am not well versed in that approach so can't speak to how it would perform or be actioned.

Traders who can find edge will take it. The more crystal clear and obvious the edge is (i.e. a signal with fundamental basis and high success rate), the more traders will arbitrage it. The more arbitrage the more volume. More volume is more liquidity.  This is the pathway being targeted. Of course nothing is guaranteed, however I see this as a viable path.

You cannot add ASICs and hash without price to support it. This will happen with time,  but arbitrarily adding additional rigs without price appreciation is a sunk cost and is guaranteed to lead to more sell pressure. Hash follows price, not the other way around.

Sound research and education is what brings long term Decred holders in and importantly, keeps them here.

Thanks for submitting the proposal so we can evaluate it properly and see what the stakeholders think. 

I actually quite like the idea of Decred showing up on billboards, especially if we could make the billboards stand out and give people a laugh or pause for thought. If the price of billboards really declines considerably because of lower traffic levels during lockdown, that could be an opportunity of sorts, where you would be hoping that the billboards get picked up on social media and shared that way. Imagine a deserted scene, usually bustling, with a billboard saying something like 
* Decred: global digital currency governed transparently by its users. * money printer does not go BRRRR

Some questions about the proposal:

1. How much would these billboards usually cost? You mention that billboards are currently inexpensive, it would be useful to know what the standard rates are and how they have been affected by presently reduced public mobility.

2. Why choose a time 6 months from now? It is difficult to predict what the situation might be that far ahead into 2020. How long would it take to go from proposal approval to billboards being up?

3. What would the 80 hours of work on designing and managing the creation of the billboards involve? To someone who is not in the billboards trade it seems like most of that would be producing images to use?

I'm not convinced about the target area, or concentrating so much in one place. The audience in these locations might be wealthy but are they impressionable enough to invest in a cryptocurrency because they saw it on a billboard?

In my view the point of this kind of campaign should be to spark as many people as possible to think ""what's this Decred thing it looks interesting"". Preferably people who are more likely to appreciate what Decred has to offer, but I don't see any way to target that specifically in the context of billboards.

1. 33% reduction in price does not seem like a good deal, considering that the reduction in public mobility during even a partial lockdown is much greater than 33%. 
2. So it seems there's an element of gambling on what the mobility situation will be like several months into the future in any scenario? I guess whoever using the billboards right now is getting pretty poor value for what they are paying, if that deal was agreed months ago. If the rate right now is down by just 33% this makes it seem like there is little opportunity to even get a reasonable deal, never mind finding a bargain.
3.  How much of the 10 hours researching and contacting billboard companies for competing quotes have you already done? It seems like this would be more useful before the proposal was approved, to know how much it will cost with greater accuracy. Or is the intention to do this after the proposal is approved to lower its cost and bill less than the budgeted amount?

Just because you're aware of the target demographic doesn't mean you'll hit it. The people who sit in cars going to work aren't predominantly entrepreneurs, but quite the opposite: employees.

1) Dcred as we know is one of the most intelligent communities in the crypto space. Sadly, intelligence does not necessarily translate to communication. The best coaches aren't always the best players.  No one i've seen has yet been able to ""dumb down"" Decred so the average intelligence person could understand w/out knowing anything about crypto. Dynamic charts, cute comics, on-chain analysis, are all technical and take a base of crypto knowledge ( at the very least) to be able to digest it. Then, still I think the majority of people don't know what a chart says, just that it sounds super intelligent therefore assumed important and not really understood by a commoner like myself.

2) In 2018 Coinbase almost released a Superbowl commercial showcasing buying crypto. The market timing is probably why they pulled the add, but it was brilliant. You watch that and you go, I want to be a part of that, let me at least look into this and see what its all about. I think this proposal can do exactly that. Make people see an ad and say let me see what that's all about. Once people enter wonderland we know it leads to the rabbit hole we all have gone in with crypto and in particular Decred.

3) With that said, I cant say the rough concept caught my attention. But, its exactly that a rough concept and I think it can be incredible with some more work. Just the sheer idea has me so excited.

We ( I ) just want people to see Decred. See first, ask questions. Does anyone remember the Plan B campaign in Miami? Incredible. People taking pictures, sharing, googling the symbol. It goes a long way. Maybe the hyper intelligent people believe that people should come organically. There is a sever disconnect between me and them. I am an evangelist for Decred and crypto. But, I spent years telling my friends and family about Bitcoin in 2014-16 and yes i'm prob not a good coach, but no interest, no one got it. I believe do something bold. Grab people attention. People will search, and some people will go down the hole and never return. People have to remember the majority of the world is of average intelligence or lower. We average folk need this.

I think however this is exactly the frame of mind to be in. Its so very different. Takes me to my point about ""Plan B"" thats pasted on the side of the monorail in Miami. Brillian! I want that for Decred. 

I will say that action to purchase crypto is not what we need/want per se. We want people to say "" what is Decred"" just like they do for bitcoin. In the UK one of the EPL soccer teams has the Bitcoin logon on their kit and all around the stadium. Its such a buzz. We want a buzz. We want people to google it. From there their path is forged. Isnt that the point of a billboard ad? To search. No one knew what GoDaddy did till they plastered it everywhere. Even their first super bowl commercials they didnt say what it did. It wasnt till the 4th that it was a domain service. Still resulted in millions of people searching for that name they just saw that doesnt know what it means. 

Doesnt need to impress that its anything other than a name and people search for it and then it all begins.

Maybe it is too early stage. But, I think it is defiantly something that would be great and its something Decred hasnt done. Look at the response of product placement in logo of Decred in that netflix series. People who know me know im in love with Decred project. I post the logo. I made a cartoon meme. And ppl that saw it msgd me and said ""thats the logo you always post! What is it? Im gonna check it out"" Just a logo! Now add a name to search. Bingo.

I wanna be like the rest of everyone, but the reality is im not as intelligent so I just hope for a dumbed down explanation in the comments.

In all seriousness, billboards are expensive. They also only have a short viewing time, so they can't be used to provide a complete selling pitch for a product, especially something as complex as Decred. They're great for two things: 1) putting out a catchy hook, with a URL/phone number for more information, which contains the actual pitch, or 2) simply impressing brand awareness in people's minds (which is what you're proposing), without consumer action at the moment. A great example of brand awareness in the US is Geico. I don't know much of anything about them, and have never dealt with them, but I'd have to be living in a cave by myself not to know that Geico sells auto insurance! They have completely impressed in people's minds the awareness that ""Geico = auto insurance."" The problem with this approach for Decred is that the general population is not acquainted with cryptocurrencies. There is no way we can impress ""Decred is a cryptocurrency"" into people's minds if they don't know what a cryptocurrency is.

Furthermore, brand awareness does nothing if there isn't something else to move people to action. The government takes care of that for Geico: you buy a car, you need auto insurance; the brand awareness kicks in, and Geico is the first company you think of. We don't have that here; even if we impress in everyone's mind ""Decred is a cryptocurrency"", we still need to somehow move people to action to purchase cryptocurrency, which is the harder part, IMO. 

In summary, billboard advertising to the general public is too early at this stage. Brand awareness will not push people to purchase cryptocurrency, and the portion of the population already interested in purchasing cryptocurrency is too small for billboards targeting them to be economical.",042d622432a68539e41e078d037556696d7c759024ef809789dfcf44e4a3609152838da906ebfb0acd82dccdd4c09e66d1363484631ebebc3072b619e636210a,1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106,2,7f2180cfd393e780fe5b798442c2e3baed4d65fbd145d52da1e9f2204ef98972d489bcc687ba3329376dcac3d1133a0a0d742551d366c10c0df70196c374d804,1586459429,8,8.0,False,8b7137f1-bb9e-46a3-bb20-f9750863aeec,ryanzim,

**Good:** 

Sticking massive logos / slogans / evocative imagery in front of lots of people over extended periods of time is an effective brand building exercise. Generally this kind of approach needs to be considered part of a consistent investment and long term strategic framework. If not, it's just a poster with some words, that appears, disappears and makes everyone feel good about having some posters up. In traditional advertising, the joke is always around the Olympics, when big sponsors buy up the posters on  the way from the airport to the stadiums - basically the senior executives feel better about spending vast amounts of money, when they can see where their money has gone.

- Option 1 - Take a long view, and assume that beyond 4 weeks, Decred commits to 12-36 months of billboards in some of the world's most expensive media real estate - Times Square etc, then of course you can shift _brand consideration_ which is basically what all of the dark arts of media measurement are based on when it comes to outdoor advertising (aka billboards). There is zero way to link this to a direct action (and no, no one will click on the QR code). 

- Option 2 - think of billboards as storytelling that just happens to be billboard size. This is not about long term, consistent investment that aims to gradually build awareness, it is about tactical impact that becomes a story in of itself, where the initial media becomes widely shared by traditional and digital media / individuals, therefore turning the initial 'media value' into a vastly more cost effective idea, that gets everyone talking.

Banksy is the modern master of this kind of approach. So when outdoor media works well, it can have extraordinary impact. 

**Bad** 

- Option 1: Might be effective long term, but from a project _values_ perspective it has zero cypher-punk credentials, but if your name is Justin Sun, it's a budget line in the marketing plan. This is before you get into the fact that there is a commonly agreed principle that _paid media_ is generally a bad thing. This might not be funneling value into Google or FB but it's still paid media, which as far as I am aware is part of the problem and not necessarily the most progressive of approaches. You might get all postmodern here and suggest that the exact cypher punk thing to do, is to use billboard advertising, to take on the establishment. If you take this view, which you would need to for this proposal to make any sort of sense, then that brings us right back to...

- Option 2 - Forget _marketing Decred_ this won't work, it's a waste of money and it will have zero impact in 4 weeks, other than making everyone in the project feel slightly special (though it's always nice to feel special). If the treasury can't fund 24 months of billboards in 20 capital cities - which I'm assuming it can't, then you are entirely reliant on the creative use of those outdoor media assets. Put simply, if you can come up with a Banksy, or have an idea, so brilliant it will return 100x - 1000x on the initial investment in terms of organic media value, through social sharing, news and follow up stories, then hell yeah. 

At this point I'm all in. The problem is you're then not paying for the ad space, you're paying for the idea. 

With a powerful projector, some VFX wizardry and a killer idea, you can make any billboard _your billboard_. 

Beyond that, you're not limited to billboards, nor do you have any timelimit. How about projecting the Decred logo on The Federal Reserve?  

At that point, the cost of the ad space should be weighed up against the cost of 2/3 people, some hardware that can be rented or bought and some crazy ideas.  

Considering the revolutionary aspirations of the technology, the _burn it all down_ ambitions of the project, I'd suggest that the approaches to brand building and awareness should be equally as revolutionary, or else don't waste the money. 

Fight Club is a big reference in the core Decred community. I think  a question that should be asked way more (and not just about this proposal) but about every aspect of the communication of the project...

1.	The standard package rate per neighborhood is $15k each. So we’re looking at a 33% discount.

2.	Wuhan recently ended their quarantine (at a total of 76 days). In some parts of the world there's already been a relaxation of social restrictions and a turn toward economic activity. However, in other places, rules are tightening and quarantine could stretch on for months. 6 months is a tentative window. Coachella, as a reference, has been pushed to October. [The LA Blockchain Summit](https://lablockchainsummit.com/) is also in October. The time it takes from “proposal approval to billboards being up,” in theory, should only take a few days, but in reality takes months. The ad spaces are rented in advance and are in high demand for album launches, concerts, movie releases etc.

3.	80 hours of work breaks out as follows:

- 10 hours of time spent researching and contacting billboard companies for competing quotes
- 30 hours designing high quality PSDs
- 15 hours of project management with billboard and printing company
- 25 hours to visit and confirm all 50 billboard sites, take photos, organize, and submit to the community


> “I'm not convinced about the target area, or concentrating so much in one place. The audience in these locations might be wealthy but are they impressionable enough to invest in a cryptocurrency because they saw it on a billboard?”

The target demographic is the upper crust, those who also tend to be entrepreneurs. So by proxy, there is potential for this campaign to attract business-level adoption.

Reference please? It may be prevalent, but how effective is it?

Below are journal references. I’ve selected some points which support the connection of brand awareness to entrant consumer choice. 

“Brand awareness is a prevalent choice tactic among inexperienced consumers facing a new decision task, subjects who are aware of one brand in a choice set tend to sample fewer brands across a series of product trials, and subjects who are aware of one brand in a choice set tend to choose the known brand even when it is lower in quality than other brands they have had the opportunity to sample.” - Effects of Brand Awareness on Choice for a Common, Repeat-Purchase Product 

 “In a situation where the consumer is aware of a number of brands which fit the relevant criteria, he or she is unlikely to expend much effort in seeking out information on unfamiliar brands. A brand that has some level of brand awareness is far more likely to be considered, and therefore chosen, than brands which the consumer is unaware of.” - Management Perceptions of the Importance of Brand Awareness as an Indication of Advertising Effectiveness

But why it’s done and how imo needs to be much more thoroughly thought over, as this would be the first instance to see DCR on billboards and is the key to the whole thing. Worth critically looking at pros/cons of other projects for starters, as this can be approached through a number of ""common strategies"".

- Strategy-wise, a brand awareness billboard campaign with just a DCR symbol + tagline is inconsiderate. There is little reason for it to be picked up or remembered when most folks might not know what’s a cc or that DCR is a cc in the first place. This type of campaigns make sense for major brands, you know to only use a symbol or logo – but taking into any account DCR’s current position shows there’s a very long way to go. 

- The rough concepts provided look terrible and illustrate an opposite story. Rather than appealing towards an upper class/elites or whatnot, a DCR symbol with a tagline next to some random busy food joints and various other billboards feels like noise, gets lost in noise, or worst risks coming off as a scammy Saul Goodman-type billboard. 

- The design related details are not coherent:  
*“30 hours designing high quality PSDs” –––– “4 design iterations with variations in color combinations and taglines such as”* – I take the design approach is using a Decred logo with a tagline added to it? That won't take 4 full days of work for any competent designer. If you’re proposing for almost 4 full days of design work, imo this needs to actually bring  much more value to the table and prove it in the proposal. Also, unless mistaken by the public Linkedin profile, you’re listed as a “Technical coordinator” at the agency mentioned, so I take it you manage operations or production essentially, but maybe not even print matters? Details like *“high quality PSDs”* while all the content is likely in vector should get the red alarm bells ringing for anyone dealing with large scale printing …

Not to bust the balls further, my point is that above mentioned tells you’ve stretched yourself horizontally. While all described can probably be delivered in some form, it seems far more sensible and likely to get some real results if you were to gather up a specialized team from that advertising agency rather, than attempting to cover it all alone. Ie. a creative director or a strategist to work out a comms + creative concept with more weight to it and present it properly; a designer with a solid experience and ability who can bring that concept to life and you in role of what you’re actually specialized in.     

Consideration for DCR stakeholders in matters of design quality and value – in many cases it makes a lot of sense to include various design or creative work as a part of the proposal. When this is proposed (or if it's missing and seems needed, consider requesting it), the proposal should involve designers or creatives with relevant specialization. The abilities, relevance of specialization and experience can be reviewed in portfolios or case studies as a proof. Alternatively, as now and as seen before, anyone with basic ps or ai skills can probably mess around with all the gh/dcrdesign assets and produce just something. This shouldn't cut it when the delivery requires bringing additional value to the table as well is charged at a comparable rate. Just devalues the whole discipline.",4adb28f484445dbec53618781e56da5095293c83e3b055e1358e7d7a054a8a4ae3c302f7503f52841992cd0a09b1a26c56529a5c97955a6c8d07889eff0b2a0c,db0979d1b10a1180ceb3bc497132a98ea3d40ecbac1d2b8a1ab687039721146c,9,965373419c12e218510616d9a97b83b2ffcb59b70f98843f66ea9362c685feb36b0bb9d17478abd6c76bb5e3db3cd07b9b7fb9192257c752e7418f3b1ef08d07,1586524692,4,4.0,False,ba96e181-abff-4c1a-b2be-9bb916ea4083,linnutee,

Pushing this expense to the Decred community suggests **one** of two things.

2. You dont really expect to make a profit from actual usage and this payment will simply dampen the impact.

1. [Criptopedia page](https://www.criptonoticias.com/criptopedia/): I can see you have BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC, XMR already, why is that the case? how are you selecting the cc that you want to be featured in this section? can you share metrics on those pages? would DCR be the first one to pay its way in? can anyone pay its way in? 
2. Sponsored articles: I see you have the tag [""anunciante""](https://www.criptonoticias.com/negocios/conoce-mejor-confiable-mezclador-bitcoin-2020/) (advertisement) in some articles and these happen to be similar in length to the ""sponsored content"" articles. What's the difference for each? why then, would you suggest sponsored content? could you be transparent and share with us the costs for a similar article posted under ""sponsored""?
3. I understand you are expanding your business and content and want to leverage the treasuries and funds out there, this on itself is something to ponder on... but before doing that, my main concern is your coverage of [sponsored articles](https://www.criptonoticias.com/?s=contenido+patrocinado): at least in the first three pages, no pure currencies are featured, you mostly showcase random projects. This might be the nature of things, but unfortunately I don't think it would sit well for Decred to be in that mix. 

Looking forward to your answers and comments.",dbf4f2c3171e7c4391b256ae5f88875b6801a3ba8902c8a62e7a74a53a600c613d925babb095b1c3530123820bcf0d83899d7a0eae7d8ca9633c1712543ca107,91e69dad1126c7258e90dda0427aa105ee682bd3149466b75899f6c969278619,7,5272637564c6cdaedc6bbe9b087561c33d0d99365b670ff48004bc4b762d6b1d22ee7bed197e8e07f47b967e085dbdc264848028bc83d6aebe66c79963f90b08,1586814362,1,1.0,False,7d508241-f156-4541-92f4-ca8a1c430d92,adcade,
8,83b59ef5ab40193a86073abbd93cea13ed6d071eecc78918ab5cf98cba7c7a67,7,"Hi adcade, thanks for the recognition and for your questions, although you might find the answers to be unsatisfactory, they gave me some ideas on how to improve things. Here I go:

1.  We create Criptopedia pages based on, first, what people is looking for on search engines like Google, second, which topic we find interesting (in pages about cryptocurrencies we think about what differentiate each of them from the others and how the community they have revolves around them).

As for the metrics, unfortunately the only cryptocurrencies with good numbers are Bitcoin (+3000 pageviews in March) and Ethereum (+1000 pageviews), others are around 200 pageviews per month; this may be happening for two reasons: these are the two most popular cryptocurrencies, and both pages are featured/linked on several pages within our website.

Regarding payment, Decred won't be the first one to pay for a Criptopedia page. RSK is already there, you can [check it out here](https://www.criptonoticias.com/criptopedia/rsk-plataforma-contratos-inteligentes-bitcoin-blockchain/). And if anyone can pay its way in, the answer is no, we select the projects we work with and not the other way around.

2. The difference is advertisement talks about and sells a product/service, while sponsored content talks about general knowledge that might have something to do with the brand sponsoring it, but doesn't sell anything. I suggest this type of content for Decred because it's what I think people would like/need to read in order to understand about this cryptocurrency and decide if they want to use it. As for the cost, it is the same we give our clients through our media kit (you can verify this by contacting publicidad@criptonoticias.com and asking for it).

3. About our coverage, the link you published is a search of the words ""contenido+patrocinado"" (sponsored+content), so the results are showing you every post that has those words in it. You can see our specific coverage for Sponsored Content under the tag [Contenido Patrocinado](https://www.criptonoticias.com/etiquetas/contenido-patrocinado/). In regard to the pure cryptocurrencies' thing, I think we can make some improvements there to feature some articles/topics that we think would interest our audience.

About the expansion, we do want to cover other cryptocurrencies/topics we find interesting, like Decred, but without the money to do so it leaves us with the decision of choosing to cover one topic or another, and we don't want to do that. So, we think treasuries give an opportunity to do it without disrupting the normal operation, i.e., to add, instead of exchange, topics.",3d86b0a0dfeaa64e9df93ebecd8aebcc0989c0b9f8f80c1f28669a5a6dadd35459bb555a953d24100afa74d1e9257e3ffe77b1cdd0539f2623e7507eaf140e04,1fff82a5bb4a5c60d169e873a5f1be40c9a129b58471d062c9a15c151bb383e9,8,e09aca1e99ce175d273a14878899126e66ca57727f5bb8f75bc26ecb01ca2da032cc73fab98d4703b86c781de008c339ae89844a000b34a9bf20e8591955b805,1586997680,1,1.0,False,8765c905-2de3-451c-b9d4-af82ddd0f69b,criptonoticias,

I would have said: do you know that TV show, ""Shark tank""?  Well it's like that, except there are thousands of sharks instead of just 5 sharks, and the sharks are really not sharks, but an assortment of seafood, plankton, some carp and trouts, and then a massive, 200 tonne, 25m massive blue whale in the middle.  It's so massive that it bends spacetime around itself.  It's a thing to behold I tell ya

So I began to appreciate the entertainment aspect of Politeia more.   ""Honk, honk!"" 

As for your proposal, it's a time of crisis now, so we will all need cartoons to keep us jolly and give that inner warmth we all need during these difficult times.  I cannot think of something more important than cartoons during times of hardship actually.  I don't see you providing metrics, and I see Instagram has cca 90 followers.  I imagine it's the same DCR people you see in ""our"" comms that like and follow these, but who cares about boring metrics.  I know this stuff is viral and let's forget about stats. Life is more than metrics and stats. Life is art.  I begin to see life more and more from an Oscar Gamboe perspective.

I like it, my only criticism is the price. I think $1350 for a comic is way undervalued. I would urge you to edit it to at least $2999. Listen, the Treasury coffers are full, we need to spend them some way.  Hiphop, cartoons, taking selfies in pubs and claling it an  'event', google/facebook ads, this is the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and undoubtedly also Tacotime.  Tacotime would be proud of what we've built, a vibrant commune.  This is cypherpunk and what crypto is all about.  

Back to the Proposal, you say it takes 9h of work to upload it to social media, I'd say make that number higher, take your time... it's covid, we all stay home longer and have more time.  Make it at least 19h. 

I'll support this but only if you ask for more, at this absurdly low price I don't have the heart to support it, it would feel like we're stealing from you, and I'm no thief.

We believe that the DCR Comic project has real use as an explanatory, brief and dynamic guide to explain the developments of Decred. Of course, due to the nature of the comic itself, there are many things that we must shorten and simplify, and for that reason we always encourage people to keep on reading at the end of each issue.

As for the approach, we wanted high impact images; of course, some people may like the drawing style much more than others. By using references from pop culture we try to bring the reader closer so that they can recognize certain aspects of this technology by comparing them. In the #7 issue - ""Atomic Swaps"", the exchange of currencies that are not from the same blockchain but from the same universe (that are not of the same type, but from the same world) make it more approachable and understandable, with a simple concept. Also, if the reader does not know the Pokemon world, they can understand that they are transactions between different type of currencies.

Regarding technicality, it is true that the community has not shown much interest in reusing the assets beyond making new stickers for Telegram, and retweets/shares, and we constantly encourage the community to do so. If you compare our 300 followers, with an average of 40 likes per publication, there are many accounts that handle a much higher volume of followers, but have much less engagement.

I do believe that it is a matter of time for the account to grow, and engagement will continue to rise. However, I do consider that the numbers could be higher, and that without the support of the community we would be advancing at a much slower pace.

As for the design of the pieces published on Twitter, it is true that they could be improved. On Instagram, where the comic is presented almost always frame by frame, the readability is improved. We might as well adopt this method, or seek another. At this point I invite you to our channel on Riot (#dcrcomic) where we can talk about this with the community too. We read your comments and lustosas's carefully and tried to leverage your knowledge working for Decred and improving the brand. I believe we have never ignored you or anyone in the community.

Finally, [I do remember your comment on #design about the use of Stakey](https://matrix.to/#/!HaHmgKVqGNlBrmPZCJ:decred.org/$15668144777496YzCPA:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org) exclusively for what 'stake' is on the project, which we took into account. Having only Stakey as Decred's only official mascot, we opted for the development of a Stakey universe (where we don't use the name 'Stakey' to refer to him to avoid confusion). We believe that a single, clear narrator who 'carries the Decred flag' is enough to explain concepts as easy as possible, although we are slowly incorporating new characters to avoid that particular issue you are pointing out.",6f9c56be05a8580c710e1e29f37344c4c7800f3973a046cf58e00b9974e678c809abaa1584596b02ea6cecf812a0aab44949da85e7bf4b5f6a227b80aedf7b05,5bc8f85fce716ed3474cb934bab485de68c8766ec7c2bbe386955e4542ca5765,11,007c868f196a20a49ac9d93bcc8294715056568dc5a5a058f19a3ae9bec2e95d0d5c3dcd2f2cd02fcf48af96c6c31da18599c35094e6e10797c53efc5a99c40c,1585077735,2,3.0,False,31623fbd-9d80-46bb-9b69-3263a86af582,nachito,1.0

I am Marcelo Lustosa, a graphic designer from Brazil, and started to work on Decred around 2017. Back then, I was reading the Decred docs and I had an insight on the topic ""The Ticket Lifecycle"": since tickets play a key role in Decred, maybe I could make a mascot from it to produce informational cartoons and explain why tickets are so important in our system. It also fits perfectly the ticket statuses: immature as a baby ticket, live as an adult one, and so on.

So i made the first comic ""[The Ticket Lifecycle](https://twitter.com/marcelolustosa/status/874751669917167618)"". The community loved the mascot, and JZ named it Stakey. Further on, i made two more comics, about the ""[ticket price algo change] (https://twitter.com/marcelolustosa/status/883377392038883329)"" - it was a thing back in the day - and the ""[Lightning Network](https://twitter.com/marcelolustosa/status/877590917288534016)"", which the project started to work with at that time. The LN comic barely feature Stakey, it only appears to say ticket holdlers approved the LN development. I was aware back then that Stakey only makes sense when we are talking about the ticket system.

Briefly later, the very first criticism started to appear. People form the community started questioning the target audience: while there were a desire to target new investors for the project, the comic audience theorically is much younger. Basically there were fear of making the project look childish and scare investors away. On the other hand, most people agree that illustrating the Decred's fundamentals could be a powerful tool to strengthen the project. There must be a healthy midterm.

Soon, the community went into a consensus, and it became kind of a mantra: ""Do not overuse Stakey"". It is fine for talk about Decred Proof-of-Stake and the related governance aspects, and community engagement or cultural approaches, as in merch for events, customized Stakey for a particular country, plush toys and *et cetera*. This is stated in the Stakey Package, under [Decred Design release on github](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/releases). In other words, I still own the copyright on the ticket drawing and **I DO NOT AUTHORIZE ANY USAGE BEYOND THESE. I feel that you are using the sympathy we build on Stakey to get your proposals approved.**

Accordingly to the comments that may follow mine, we can consider setting up a proposal to pass all rights on the ticket mascot to Decred Holdings Group, and in case it gets approved, the mascot would be usable for whatever stakeholders approve on Politeia. 

Otherwise, you need to find graphic solutions to the other aspects of Decred universe that you willing to cover, instead of using the ticket mascot for privacy, miners, dex, traders, developers and so on, as you done until now. I've provided you an example when you first came with your cartoons [here](https://matrix.to/#/!HaHmgKVqGNlBrmPZCJ:decred.org/$156710366013788PlxAF:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org) but you simply ignored it.

When we began working on the comics with pablito, we looked at the design repos to see how we could contribute to the project. We've always worked on comms so this was the way in which we thought we could provide more value to Decred.

When we found Stakey, we loved it, developed the first comic and published it on the #design Matrix channel. We thought we had your approval. We only wanted to generate content for the community and saw Stakey as the correct vehicle to explain Decred to the broader public.

We never ignored your comments, we thought carefully about what you and linnutee told us. We saw the ""miner-robot"" comic and we concluded having a single character would be the best in order to simplify the comics.

Seeing this comment, we could've paid more attention or dug deeper into the conversation. Being an open-source project, we thought we could just use every asset. We didn't know you held the rights or how much did the community discuss Stakey's usage beyond ""Proof-of-Stake"".

We never intended to ignore or disrespect any of you, even less to try to use the love the community has for Stakey to get our proposals approved. We are here to collaborate and help build Decred, that's why we are working on the comics, the animation, the website and printed booklets events.

**This comment made us reevaluate our approach and this proposal will be put on hold till we solve this issue. We will work on new characters to talk about miners, traders, developers, community members and other activities that make up the Decred ecosystem. We will update this proposal with proofs-of-concept of each new character and later discuss what should we do with the previous comics.**",98081a1c1d2b3dcedd2af556219721d7b2464930a0649b1ce81fa7c9a688020b65e1c0e5ab9f5fbde3ea613be1f62c2eae4b1341af1fdde27c6dec0bc40ac204,5bc8f85fce716ed3474cb934bab485de68c8766ec7c2bbe386955e4542ca5765,15,c825541b78dad692023fc122034d0a6d59c2cbbf1a7898c4a6298e23b8dffe51ba0ddfd8e6336c4c11949e9323a5e9922f31c5296e675c6444c3f8daf5be9e04,1585170882,5,6.0,False,31623fbd-9d80-46bb-9b69-3263a86af582,nachito,1.0

Anyway, I'll try to answer everything you pointed out:

1. Most Twitter metrics are public, we've focused on that platform and I've uploaded a visualization of the data I've scrapped from the @dcrcomic account. If you want more metrics, let me know what kind of stats do you care about, I'll gladly grab them and post them.
2. If you think the product of our work if overvalued, we can discuss how/where to cut work hours.
3. Those 9 hours of SM management include the work we do every day. We not only upload the comics, but generate content and try to use the small but growing reach the @dcrcomic account has to spread new developments or bits about Decred's culture that could help newcomers understand how the community operates. The [previous proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2ef74fa5f0b558442cb85b1235c8c551a51ff5d8b8de44dead48b8b59c8fc1de) included only 4 hours of SM management per comic, that's just 8 hours per month to manage several accounts. With little resources, we managed to provide much needed content (in the form of retweets) for the main @decredproject Twitter account. We added hours because we find ourselves working more on it because we believe it is needed.

I completely agree with your take on metrics/data and that the Treasury should carefully spend it's reserves. It might not be the best time to present this proposal, but I'm starting to see it never is. Now, with most events cancelled, I would argue that it is also not the best time to cancel content generation projects.

Yes, this is a cryptocurrency, a cypherpunk thing. But it is also a community driven project and maintaining and spreading the culture requires work. Sadly, because of people like you that try its best to offend others who may not know how to start collaborating with the project it takes a lot of work to close the gap between those who can code and those who may but see it as an activity reserved for geniuses and top-school engineers. Cryptocurrency is not only ""cypherpunk"", it is about inclusion and this kind of messages are not helping us get more hands to work on the repos. If you want more cypherpunk, help us get more people contributing with the project or start coding yourself.

This is not about you pointing out what this proposal lacks or should improve. This is about the tone.",92308b63c1ad547bc53e6df6423a81d97d6f681d9799a330fdcb4f26b2b016077d9123aa7a9b2deb433ff7348548d587c5312025e91f16f75973b5c9ff74e901,78d8ff0b05d20c593ab45a2ff3d55dd61b421bc599585e6c5cc2e409947dd950,2,a8062d2c8ce52567d775f1e15a2462d1acb9b657619715a05f4be72d159b2882f01437ce40452a4301a24f4bf606983443df4a667f66e00b2fc2408f82290109,1585004706,3,6.0,False,65b2d0d7-44a3-4f5d-9d45-8f6a9a9d3364,pablito,3.0

I am sorry you didn't like the comics. However, I would like to invite you to our channel on Riot (#dcrcomic) if you wish to contribute with feedback to make it better.

We didn't survey people, but we got feedback from several readers who got the comic at events:

- At LABITConf (https://www.labitconf.com/) where we brought the first printed comics, people found very interesting how we explained the technology that Decred develops, and at the end of each day we ended without comics. To this day I still think that it would have been better to carry even more, since most asked for all the numbers (at that time, we had made the first five), or just a pair that seemed more interesting to them. At the same time, when we approached stands and people in general, it was a great method of starting conversations with them and being able to compare projects.

- Other meetups where we took them were organized by Tomee and Camilolwi in the Argentine NGO Espacio Bitcoin. In these meetups we had the first booklets (a first model of these actually, the last ones are uploaded on the DCR Comic GitHub for those who want to print them: https://github.com/pLabarta/dcrwebcomic/tree/master/Swag/). Since they were events dedicated to talking about Decred, we had a space to leave them (unlike LABITConf, where we went ""hijacking the boots"" like someone well said). They really worked the same way: people grabbed them, read one, and usually grabbed one and usually grabbed one more or all of them. In this situation, more people approached us asking about working for a DAO and what our experience was like, since it was precisely a strong point to discuss in this type of meeting.

I think on a general scale it was well received and had a positive impact on those who owned it.",fbe94af8635be68e431b9b2f98d2be5359af55317bca6bdcef3d86e35d806c5c333637b931ee5902b13987c27da7bc2476ec3f0ebf01f349398e535e7e6b8d01,5bc8f85fce716ed3474cb934bab485de68c8766ec7c2bbe386955e4542ca5765,20,5fcb673f91c0720a666cf5e7ea0b2fdba1e49283bd6e69950879bd131dfa8de83b20a4a2cf3c6cb898d3afeb85afece8bd06dad0b2c6508b13af49ae44fa0501,1586547698,0,1.0,False,31623fbd-9d80-46bb-9b69-3263a86af582,nachito,1.0

Even after the first proposal has passed and delivered I have mixed feelings about this project.

To me you have demonstrated solid design skills, ability to integrate with the community, self-manage and deliver, and in general that you care about Decred. I also appreciate how you responded to lustosa's request and introduced new characters (centris and candlestonk are funny, you guys just ""get it"").

On the other hand, I'm not sure the comic is working well to onboard new people.

While I'm still undecided about DCR Comic, I know a few things for sure. You guys have demonstrated useful skills and ability to deliver that can be applied in other areas. For example, building static or animated infographics to explain Decred, build social media presence, or contribute to improving the UX of Decrediton and mobile wallets. One approved proposal and 3.5K Yes votes on this one show that you have a significant amount of support from the stakeholder community that would help in other endeavors.

This is due to little actual result being brought to table on meaningfully explaining concepts as well the created assets not being picked up in practical use. The presented ""why?"" – as to just ""highlight a need … to do all kinds of things"" doesn't hold up. I doubt the 1st round of comics brought in any new contributors, grew the community significantly or was often referred to in cases asking for support/questions. Thus i'll be voting no. 


**Concept/Approach**

The authors have taken an approach of combining low hanging pop culture references with Stakey, and extending it on various topics. Where-as this approach is quite common in marketing and advertising things, it tends to fail on making complex and novel topics easier to understand. 

In my opinion, the latest comics obfuscate and dumb down what should not be dumbed down, but ratherbe  thoughtfully simplified and eloquently communicated. Ie. reviewing the last three comics, the way the narrative comes together with the visuals and copy is just not very comprehensible (dcrtime - back to future, atomic swaps - pokemons?), as there's no clear addressing of an idea or a point. Instead, this lack of clarity on making a point with the narrative is hidden in noise – screaming visuals and over the top emotions. Making characters super emotional doesn’t explain anything. Making things visually overwhelming and super flashy might make it catchy for some and for the first few times, but becomes very annoying after a while.


**Technicalities **

As stated there's been no interest from the community in re-using the assets. So I take it that the social media accounts would be the only considerable output left. Dcrcomic account posts average some ~40 likes, combined with a quite small following of ~300 users, which I would question if they are mostly made up of existing community members? Considering the amount of content being hammered out and ~20% of each comics budget going to ""posting on/adapting to social networks"" – the numbers aren't favoring. 

Notably the accounts' most popular post is the [Ticket Rick with infringing Rick & Morty screencaps](https://twitter.com/DCRComic/status/1204049820350111744). If you're being paid to produce the content, you can't just post a modified image of copyrighted content. Adult Swim/Warner Bros are particularly hard on copyright infringements. Something to think about here is also the fact that this piece of content, which in my books shouldn't even pass as acceptable, significantly outperforms the rest of the content you're paid to create. 

From design standpoint, the comics in twitter aren't properly legible. Being difficult to read is a failure at explaining. Simply uploading print standard A4 size images without any optimizing, and expecting everything to be well readable on various screens doesn't work. Ie. [on a 27"" screen I need already to squint my eyes at default full size](https://twitter.com/DCRComic/status/1222874521507717121). Ever tried looking at this on mobile even?


**Appropriateness **

Both myself and Lustosa have given you feedback in #design/riot prior to the initial proposal of not stretching Stakey across every single aspect of the project. I take it was largely just ignored, as afterward there has been no attempt to contact or bring things up for feedback even. So i’ll repeat the point – Stakey was designed with intention of explaining Staking. Taking it across every other aspect of the project leads to cognitive dissonance by making the metaphors conflict. 

I like Stakey as a way to explain staking, I'm fine with authentic Stakey memes being made here and there and where reasonable – I don’t like artificial cult of stakey as DCR’s another ad campaign.

Publishing all the information in one place is not centralization, it is the creation of another place and a new channel for promoting the Decred ecosystem. As everyone knows the more independent distribution channels we have, the better it will be for the project as a whole. There are many examples that we can not rely upon at one source of information, as it can ""die"" at any time.

Milestones copied 6 times because we will have 6 different milestones that we will work on for 6 months, this is done in order to visualize our work.

About Reddit, of course, it could, but for some reason, it does not perform this function, and as we know the Decred Twitter audience is far bigger than the Reddit audience.

The more individual or individual users or experts support social networks, the better it will be for the ecosystem.

My initial reaction to this was: wow, quite bold to ask 2x more for one single country than the entire LATAM Proposal asked for, and almost 3x more than the entire European Proposal. Also, considering the latter got rejected at $50k (for the entire continent of Europe, and also included established members like karamble, haon), as a stakeholder I expect extraordinary evidence for why such a sum is justified.

For perspective, you ask for $125k for events in a single country, while the DEX, one of the most daring and infrastructurally central projects for the whole DCR ecosystem asked for between $100k and $250k.  Something seems off in this picture.

In the **Why?** section you list things that you believe set your community apart from the others, but what I would expect is something different: I would expect you to talk more about what justifies this sum for 2020. How old the community is, whether it was there before coin’s launch or not, shouldn’t be a reason to ask for a vastly larger sum.  The money Proposal submitters get on Pi shouldn’t be some kind of “loyalty reward” for being with the project for a long time.  I know you were promoting DCR from the earliest days, it goes way back to bitcointalk etc.  Still, that should play only a minor role, if any at all.   

Statements about what the Proposal submitter *believes* to be the case are insufficient and require supporting evidence:

>I currently believe that we are only behind the USA in number of active members.

What is this “current belief” based on, specifically?  Not necessarily denying this, but it would need an explanation: is it based on the metrics of some specific platform like Facebook?  Do you believe that to be an appropriate metric to gauge the sizes of the communities?

>We’ve already had cases where the Decred website had more accesses from Brazil than from the USA.

Is this anecdotal, from your memory, or is there a metric for this available somewhere?  Is the metric 'Sybil resistant'?

>the BR community had around 5,000 members. Today, at the height of alt winter, we have around 6,000. We grew 20% while most other altcoins communities lost several members.

If the BR community is so vibrant and active, why do the YouTube videos have 20, 30, 40 views …? This is very low [Link to channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DecredBrasilOficial/)

>During the years 2016 and 2017 I paid for events and marketing campaigns for DCR in Brazil and also in other countries including the Middle East with my own money and in some cases with the help of other Brazilian members

That is wonderful and deserving of respect, however, it shouldn’t directly impact people’s decision regarding the adequacy of this proposal and its ask.

> $11,000.00 for sponsor and participation in around 8 big events, organization of around 13 meetups and small events.
>$22,000.00 for transport, accommodation and food expenses.
>$79,000.00 for expenses with hours worked by more than 18 members.

Could you go into a little more detail about what this $80k of labour entails? Can you break it down a little?
We should also remember that the cost of living and average pay in Brazil is drastically lower than in Europe. When we consider this fact, doesn’t asking for 3x more than the European Proposal require more elaboration?

---

With the outbreak of the Corona Virus, people are avoiding large public events. Many wealthy major corporations have publicly canceled their own events. Why should Decred Stakeholders finance costly Brazil meetups, can we count on these events producing tangible results regardless of a possible global pandemic?

---

As someone who’s been with the project for a long time, you have witnessed how DCR struggled price-wise vs BTC in the last 2 years, don’t you think we should try to be austere in our spending, to avoid adding unnecessary sell pressure?

In any case, I look forward to your responses, and updates to the Proposal.

I'm basing it on facts. Brazil is objectively cheaper than, say, California. So organizing an event in Brazil must be cheaper. It's not my opinion and it has nothing to do with what the media shows about Brasil, it's just a fact that should be taken into account when we evaluate how much money should be spent for creating events in that part of the world.

In a general context you are right to say that organizing an event in BR is cheaper than in Europe and that is why we can participate in a larger number.

But this is relative. I cite Campus Party São Paulo again, which costs from $50,000 to $400,000. Around the same price as the Web Summit in Europe.

But we always got a good place in it for free with several lectures on the main stages.
We have already had 8 lectures in a single conference.

Campus Party is a a great event in the chosen cities during the year. Being the only altcoin present alongside bitcoin in the blockchain arena is very relevant. Sometimes ETH, Dash and Zcash also participate, but because they have to pay the true cost, they are infrequent.

In my opinion, we cannot pass up this opportunity for now, even if it requires a good investment in logistics and hours worked.
The same goes for Bitconf and the Cointelegraph/Criptofacil Summit

Your questions were very relevant and helped me to clarify somethings, Praxis. Thank you.

- The amount asked for is a lot, considering its for 18 members it may be justifiable. 
- Looking at covid-19 spreading and still growing, there is a good chance big events may not achieve good results. Could some events be shifted to online / more localized /smaller scale? 
- I seen discussion about population of Br is more - this may or may not justify higher cost to be allocated. Perhaps we can also look at purchasing power / GDP per population? ( i dont like seeing china/india proposal asking for gigantic amount and justify it with population/land area. 
- I feel this is a big plan and maybe it should be scaled down and making it 6 mths to make it more consumable before growing it to full scale. 
- At current DCR prices this or any marketing/community plans will eat up treasury significantly. I also agree it is important so we need to spend carefully. 

Another of my concern is unbalance distribution of treasury funds, when the EU proposal just been rejected and a large amount is allocated to Br/Latam, will this go to a cycle where more users in Latam/Br buy DCR and vote positively on props for their own geolocation, eventually skew the project to one side of the world, making it a one country/region project ? I imagine if every country has only X% of population would be willing to own CC (because CC is not for everyone), having large amount of fund on one region and minimum funds on other region is not the most effective way of growing the project. Does this concern you emillio ? What is your view to grow the project in a balance manner. 

Would love to see more discussion to help me make up my mind on this vote. Good Luck !

About covid19, so for while in Brazil we have only 19 confirmed cases of people who mostly came from other countries, almost all of them foreigners. Two cases of internal contamination. Contaminated Brazilians have mild symptoms.

The common flu kills around 650,000 people a year worldwide. 
Proportionally a much larger number than has been attributed to covid19.
The H1N1 virus is much more aggressive than the corolla and in its epidemic there was not as much despair as it is now.

I really don't know how things are going in other countries because I don't believe in the press and the images it shows, especially in times of world crisis when the owners of the world need to find a ""culprit"" for it.

Of course, the illness exists and has spread around the world, what I question is the real severity of the symptoms and the percentage of cases of death.
You are in China, right? Do you personally know a confirmed case? Do you know anyone who has passed away? Or just follow the numbers released and TV scenes on hospitals in alarm?
The last information I had is that the number of people infected by the second variant of the virus is already decreasing in China.

We now had carnival in Brazil and nothing different happened. For while no events have been canceled and the population is not so alarmed as to stop attending.

As I replied to Praxis, it's obvious that if that happens, the money will not be spent and will remain in the treasury.
We will spend less than what we asked to be available for the year. This can also happen without any event being canceled.
It's the first time that marketing is being decentralized. Everything is still experimental. If there is any possibility of spending less, you can be sure that I will spend less. 

What I don't agree with is starting to decentralize, thinking about do less than what has been done, when it is evident that there is a need to be seen more than we are.

About the European proposal to be disapproved, I commented to Praxis that imho this happened due to the lack of information and because a realistic account was not made.
You can be sure that the next one will have a much higher value because $49,000 a year doesn't pay even half of their hours worked.

LATAM and Brazil don't receive more for marketing than other regions. And we have given back a very good result.
Any proposal with a value lower than ours will be unrealistic and will need another one after a few months to complement the costs.
We are being the first to try to decentralize these expenses and showing investors the amounts spent. 

You can be sure that it would be much easier for us to continue as we did in 2019 and leave the accountability for @Dustorf to explain.

The Decred self-financing treasure through 10% of the coins mined in each block is an amazing feature developed among other things to invest in marketing. 

As the currency appreciates, which I am sure will happen, that amount will correspond to a lower dcr value coming out of the fund

I have faith that this bearmarket moment will end in 2021 and we will no longer need to spend so much on marketing.
The market will promote us.

You are the Asia community manager, right?
I believe that when you elaborate your proposal, you will have a better idea of ​​the costs involved to create and maintain a strong community, with an independent ecosystem and with good investors.

Thanks for the questions!

If you pay attention, you will see that LATAM's proposal is for 6 months, totaling approximately a total of 144k per year.
The BR proposal involves expenses already in March, such as Campus Party Amazonia, therefore 10 months and with a maximum projection of 125k per year. 

As it is written, Brazil has almost the same population of all other Latin American countries together, around 40%. Also almost the same area as all the others together. In addition, between Brazilian states there are great cultural and ethnic differences that don't exist or are very few between the Hispanic countries. For example, the state of Bahia is practically an African country within Brazil. The Amazon, an indigenous descendants country, more Japaneses lives in Sao Paulo than anywhere else in the world. Santa Catarina looks like a little Germany. Parana is known as ""Brazilian Russia"" and several other examples. Only those who have been here and got to know from north to south understand the differences. We are a lot of countries within a single country. 

Regarding the European proposal, imho, it's fail on some points. There is a lack of better detail to the requested amount that besides other things is insufficient even to pay the contractors working hours, so I believe it was not approved but I am sure that if it is redone more carefully, it will be successful.

Comparing marketing and events with DEX or another feature to be developed does not make any sense.
Both are important and totally different things.

Each has its peculiarities in relation to cost. Development we are talking about hours worked and that deserve to be paid well.
Marketing and events involve much more things and services from third parties. Air tickets, hotel, food, purchase of gifts, banners, assembly of booths, etc.

As an example, a place at Campus Party Sao Paulo costs from $ 50,000 to $ 400,000. We got it for free.

The DEX will be amazing, but decred is already an amazing currency.
What is missing? Marketing. And this is not the time to reduce costs with this.

Good marketing is what we do in Brazil and now we see Elian's team doing for Hispanic countries in Latin America as well.
I don't see a reason why BR deserves a smaller budget than the rest of LATAM if it involves practically the same number of people in 26 states that are totally different from each other.

You approach Brazil in a prejudiced manner, saying that Europe's contractors should receive more, because here people are poorer and things cheaper. I don't condemn you because I consider the international and also the internal medias guilty of defending foreign interests in making us appear poorer and more savage than we are.

Any promotional film or documentary about Brazil only shows poverty. I think Paris must have more homeless people than any Brazilian city that I know. I have seen images of bagda at war saying it was in BR.

Take a look at the photos I put up of the meetups and you will see some Brazilian cities as they are. Of course, there is poverty here, but everywhere there is, the difference is that other countries hide it.

As written in the text, we have 7 devs of decred who are Brazilian, apart from the USA which other country has the same number?
I don't think they should receive less just because they are Brazilian.

Yes, there are cheaper basic things here. Probably for a poor person it makes a difference, but for those who are middle class it is the opposite. A car that costs $70,000 in the USA, costs $180,000 in Brazil.

For reasons of privacy and security, an agreement was reached that it should not be disclosed how much each contractor receives, but I can assure you that my hours worked are the cheapest of the entire team, and by my choice. I dedicate much more hours a day to decred than I receive. But this is a personal decision of mine, you cannot reach a worker and say: ""you will receive less than him because you are a Latin American."" Please ...

I am cautious about spending during these market conditions and I anticipate it to get worse. But the amount of community building work done and the commitment of people mentioned is a huge argument in favor of this proposal. The fact that emiliomann did a lot of outreach for Decred with his own funds and negotiated a lot of event slots for free makes me confident that he will spend Treasury funds carefully. I would love to see what BR community is capable of when supported by decent Treasury funding.

However, I have a few questions and concerns that I would like to clear to help with my vote choice.

1\. My biggest issue with this proposal is that it lacks any details for its biggest item which is man hours.

$78,000 is 3,900 hours at $20/hour, 1,950 hours at $40/hour and so on. I don't know the exact rates of each contractor (and not asking for them), but in any case it is _a lot_ of marketing hours. This amount deserves much more explanation than a single short bullet.

I am further concerned that praxis [requested](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/bc20f986c3ea2fed2ea074c377a89f1a4b956ea0d527a8b6c099a5a8f175beb5/comments/1) to break down this figure 16 days ago but it was not done and the vote started without it. You [replied](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/bc20f986c3ea2fed2ea074c377a89f1a4b956ea0d527a8b6c099a5a8f175beb5/comments/2) that how much each contractor receives will not be disclosed to protect their privacy, but individual earnings is not what was requested. It was asking to provide a breakdown of deliverables and how much resources each will consume, similar to how it was presented in the [US Marketing](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c830ea5afea45a0aabf4092d1bea51fb10b8bfa2d8474aac03224f0f94d3d1af) proposal.

I appreciate the background information and story in this proposal but when it comes to the key term of the contract all it says is ""Up to $78,000.00 for expenses with hours worked by more than 18 members."". This is not telling me at all what the components are and if they have a reasonable price.

While I trust that you will spend with great care, I don't know the same about others. I trust the ""I can assure you that my hours worked are the cheapest of the entire team"", but it is the _other_ hours I know nothing about. Besides, to my knowledge you as a proposal owner will not even be able to review, approve or reject expense items of other contractors (please correct me if it is possible in CMS now).

2\. Could you publish high level _monthly_ progress and expense reports (like [this one](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/marketing-latam/updates/20200103.md))? I think waiting a full year to get a report is too long. I wrote about why reporting is so important to keep stakeholders engaged in the [US Marketing](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c830ea5afea45a0aabf4092d1bea51fb10b8bfa2d8474aac03224f0f94d3d1af/comments/41) proposal and [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/fa70c3/decred_2019_marketing_report/fkyqomn/).

3\. I know that Facebook and Instagram are dominant social media platforms in Brazil. Can you please comment on your strategy for making the best use of these platforms? e.g. do you have dedicated people to post frequently, how often do you plan to create and post new video/audio/articles, etc.

4\. What was the level of engagement with past Decred content in Portuguese? Is it falling/staying flat/growing?

Good luck!",3fc5fa1b9f5194ac285e97e75720c08e97990f0d399e8b3318007a06e6ab091d67feb44b540e6380b6fe42d379ff41a520de1f6323f199b54c01fa0edb64410d,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,24,b8b49799fc7ae0def5a520da6050307e22be822eb1b3bbb2c5abb043f3bd3f6ab6a69b2c886f0dc5dd5124c93936b71f487aaaa2ac56ff6f49ecd0a5fd4bd409,1584911846,4,4.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

 **EMILIO AS COMMUNITY MANAGER**  
 In case you don't know, the guy here is completely anonymous. Only a very small group of people (3 or 4 in the whole brazilian bitcoin community) know who he really is in real life (and I think Jake came to know him personally too). Ok, I fully understand (and even support) the anonymity in this ecosystem, but I really think that things would be more transparent and secure if we could know who is the person that will be managing all this money.

 And more: Emilio (who will be in charge of all these DCR) NEVER personally participated in ANY Decred marketing related event. Ask members who are always at all events how many times they have seen Emilio in person at any of these events. You can verify this fact asking about it in the brazilian community.
 
Do you see him in any of the photos in this post? No, **that's right: the brazilian community manager has NEVER ATTENDED AND PHYSICALLY PARTICIPATED IN ANY DCR EVENT**. And yet, he is asking us to put more than $ 100,000 of DCR treasure in his hands to manage marketing and events in Brazil. Could you please explain to me how does that make any sense?
 
Please, understand that I have nothing in particular against Emilio. We all know that he really did a great job creating a Brazilian community at the beginning of DCR and also in many other efforts related to DCR. I'm just exposing reality here as it is.

*****

**SOCIAL METRICS AND THE TRUE SIZE OF THE BRAZILIAN COMMUNITY**  
[The Decred Brasil Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/decredbrasil/), despite having 5k + members, doesn't seem to have even 50 active members. Do you doubt that? [Check it for yourself](https://www.facebook.com/groups/decredbrasil/). Join the group and check the posts and interactions (comments, likes, etc).

For every 10 posts in the group, 7 are from Emílio, 2 are advertisements from Bitconf staff and only one really belongs to a member asking questions or is a discussion between members of the community. The Brazilian community seems to have only diminished over time (one way to analyze this is through interactions in the group's posts). 

Yes, the Brazilian community is of course much bigger than those 50 active members in the group, but most of us decided to stop participating in the group due to the dictatorial behavior of the group's creator: Emilio.

Remember: brazilians are COMPLETELY ADDICTED to social networks like Facebook and Instagram. So, these are great metrics to measure social engagement in our country. Now that you've verified the group, also check out the interactions on [Instagram Decred Brasil](https://www.instagram.com/decredbr/) (and come on, give it a follow!).

And let's not forget [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC73wa2ddXuPWsmenVfeFTYg): yes, it counts ALL views. Even if you are not logged in. They only distinguish between IPs. But even if the statement (that the platform only counts views of logged accounts) were correct, what matters is that the numbers are extremely low. Just compare it to other channels of crypto communities.

*****

**LOCAL MEETUPS, INCLUDING THOSE 5 THAT TOOK PLACE ON DCR'S ANNIVERSARY**  
Brazil has 26 states, but in how many of them have DCR done or participated in something relevant? Let's be honest here: 99% of the interest and activity related to cryptocurrencies here in Brazil is concentrated only in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Don't try to use size or number of states as an argument, because it just doesn't make sense.

And about the 5 meetups that took place on Decred's birthday, they only happened because 3 to 5 DCR were PAID by Emilio to be spent on beer for anyone who gathered more than 5 people (even if it was your own family or any random friends who have no interest in crypto at all) in a bar, using swag from DCR (distributed for free, i.e., more useless expenditures from the treasury) and took pictures of if. You can also check this out in the group Decred Brasil, in Emilio's posts.

*****

**ON THE TWO MAIN EVENTS CITED BY THE PROPOSAL'S AUTHOR**  
**1: CAMPUS PARTY**  
This one is indeed a big and prestigious event for the technology community. But DCR's participation in these events usually comes down to one or two 30-minute lectures with something between 20 to 30 people watching (which is great anyway, I know and agree totally with this!), and a lot of distribution of t-shirts and other swags to attendees of the event. Just remember that this is not a specific event for crypto.

And about the **affirmation that ""a place at Campus Party Sao Paulo costs from $ 50,000 to $ 400,000"", do you have any evidence about this? Where can we find these prices?** All speakers I know who have participated, were INVITED to participate and still had all their expenses paid for the event (after all, that's why the attendees buy their tickets and participate in the event).

**2: BitConf (REALLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION HERE)**  
BitConf, was (until last year) probably the biggest cryptocurrency event in Brazil, and it used to attract many enthusiasts and investors, but over the years it has turned into an event that basically exists to enrich its creator. Any company or business can participate, as long as they pay the sponsorship fees. Since **their only filter is money, it turned into a perfect opportunity for scammers and companies that act as pyramid scheme (ponzis) to convey an image of credibility and find new victims for their scams.**

Mainly in the last year (2019), the Brazilian cryptocurrency community suffered SEVERELY because of this. Thousands and thousands of people have lost ALL their money and we are still watching this story unfold. **Every new week, we see the news of investors who lost everything in those scams, and, sadly, it went so far that some of them took their own lives (suicide).**

All this because the administrator of this event (Wladimir Crippa) accepted the sponsorship and publicly endorsed several times all those ""companies"" in his facebook group (Bitcoin Brasil, with 100+ thousand members), despite the several attempts of the group members to warn him and the community that those companies were clearly scams. And do you know what happened to everyone who tried to do that? They were simply banned from the group (sometimes by Emilio, who is also a moderator in that group and a long-time friend of Wladimir Crippa). At one point it got so out of control that they had to activate the approval of posts in the facebook group, and this continues until today.

**SO PLEASE, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO CONTINUE ASSOCIATING AND TARNISHING THE IMAGE OF DECRED WITH THIS EVENT (BitConf), AT LEAST DO IT WITHOUT USING TREASURY MONEY.**  

Little detail: the event organizer is wanted by the Brazilian police. I don't remember the reason, but I'm sure it's not related to cryptocurrencies, nor is it anything recent. Anyway, it's just an additional detail.

Anyone who has doubts about all this exposed above about BITCONF, please ask publicly (just create a post) in the [**""free speech"" BITCOIN BRASIL facebook group**](www.facebook.com/groups/bitcoin.brasil.2/). This facebook group was created when the administrators of the Bitcoin Brasil group limited the members' discourse, mainly regarding the operations of these companies (ponzi schemes). [There](www.facebook.com/groups/bitcoin.brasil.2/), unlike in the group managed by Wladimir and Emilio, you can write and discuss whatever you want freely, as long as it is not advertisement of financial pyramids and other scams.

ATTENTION: do not confuse this group with the ""BITCOIN BRASIL - ORIGINAL"". The owner of the last  is also the creator of BITCONF (Wladimir Crippa) and he has banned thousands of members who 'asked inappropriate questions' about the sponsors of this event, which is simply **DISGUSTING**.

**THE USD PURCHASE POWER IN BRAZIL**  
I believe that the amount requested in this proposal is ABSURD and **totally out of the Brazilian reality**.

The dollar is EXTREMELY VALUED in Brazil at the moment. In fact, it's at its historic highs. In other words, USD purchase power has never been greater in Brazil than it is today. That means that with fewer dollars, you do a lot more. The amount requested here is ridiculously high and the results are extremely doubtful.

FYI, the minimum monthly salary in the country is something like 200 usd or 6.6 usd/day (30 days conversion) and the national average salary in 2019 was about 455 dollars or 15 usd daily (30 days converted).

So, using the average salary as base, if each of those 18 members (who are they, exactly?) work at the events, on average, 20 days a year (I very much doubt it!!) at the events, it would cost a total of no more than $ 5500 (18 members x 20 days x 15 usd / day). Help me understand why they are charging $ 80,000 for it. Why should these people be paid almost 15 (FIFTEEN!!!) times the average Brazilian salary??

*****

**COVID-19**  
Finally, as mentioned in other comments, the Corona virus outbreak will directly impact those events for at least the next 4 to 6 months. **I believe that most of them will not even happen in 2020.**

Despite my reservations, **for a maximum amount of 25% of this current budget (up to 30,000.00 USD), and after the resolution of the coronavirus crisis**, I would really CONSIDER voting in favor of this proposal. But in the structure presented today, thinking about the financial health and the long-term future of the DCR treasury and development, it's a big NO for me.

I'm here to answer any additional questions about what I wrote, but I really recommend that before you seek to check and confirm all the facts exposed here with the Brazilian Decred and Bitcoin community itself.

The group is closed, so it's possible to know how many people have accessed it and the posts that have been viewed. Recalling that although it does not appear, there is a private messenger where several discussions take place in different rooms, with different people in the group.

About youtube, it only counts people who are logged on youtube or some google service like gmail or others in the background.

I honestly think that covid19 is not as dangerous as they are making you believe it is. Nothing has been canceled in Brazil so far and no one has died. If the events are canceled or we consider that the cost does not pay to participate because the reduction in the public, it's obvious that we will not go and the money will not be spent.

That amount is a ceiling for us to use with marketing. It doesn't mean that we will spend everything. 

Anyone who knows me knows that I do my best to save the most money from the treasury.

You should know this, because even after 2017 I approached you asking for the indication of journalists from cointelegraph and coindesk to pay with money from the BR community for publications and articles. I've always been behind publicity for decred inside and outside Brazil.

As stated in the proposal, this year of 2020, we have already held 5 meetups with money from me and other BRs.

I agree that the treasure must be spent carefully and rationally. However, at this point, marketing is fundamental. 

Decred needs to stop being a underdog and take the place it deserves in the mainstream. And for it to happen, DCR needs to appear. 

When that happens we can think about stopping spending on marketing. The market itself will promote Decred.",29a5f95337d66f3b4e348ede219d17f6550c432bd84f016e8880fd8b160596ccb62efd151b1a6cebfef9d47a3758a30cf1f04612e6a1b25cda1e30c0784ea805,c1cd38140c03bf6c34130ae6f89e592fb13ecad9b83aa660ffd8a74da4655d38,3,ac3ce75186b39d92c61791983f53336ae5a075fbd637a13d7305709258d2535701ea76c292be4e2e1a151e72465153680faa498475a722e8649ac1bcb8c1e800,1583557676,12,12.0,False,2c5adebc-b861-447c-90c1-6af50f012ce8,emiliomann,

I typically do not like to comment on marketing proposals because it is not my primary domain and I prefer that proposals stand on their own merits, versus me influencing their outcome.

I have been working with Emilio informally since 2016 and as a contractor since 2017.  To date, he has delivered the most of any individual marketing contractor and has done it at a fraction of the cost of every other contractor.  Critics will immediately point to a lack of metrics to justify this claim, as if metrics from centralized pro-censorship tech giant websites is the only way to judge output.  Instead of relying on metrics on sites that cannot give any meaningful measure of conversions for a cryptocurrency project, let's have a look at the things that actually matter:

* The project has more BR devs than from any other nation state besides US.  If it were not for C0, BR would have the most devs.
* The BR devs are honest, hard-working, and easy to get along with.  They have taken the initiative in many cases and now are leads on several repositories, e.g. decrediton, politeiagui, pi-ui, dcrlnd, and other LN repos.
* Decred has had a presence at major BR cryptocurrency events for several years at this point.  I have attended 2 conferences in BR in Q2 2018 (Bitconf in SP) and Q1 2019 (Campus Party in SP).  At Bitconf, the crowd was roughly 200 people, and at Campus Party, it was roughly 100 people.
* Emilio has advised me to avoid a couple prospective BR contractors, and I did not listen to him.  It ended up he was absolutely correct and these people were troublemakers and had to be terminated as contractors.  Some of the vitriol in the comments here almost certainly originates from those individuals or their associates.
* Of all the events and locations I have been to, the community members I met in BR were the most excited and easiest to get along with.  The project has made a real impact on the lives of people in BR, not just devs or other project contractors, and you can see and feel it in person.

I do acknowledge that the budget itemization could be better in the proposal, but based on the relative ease of working with Emilio for the past several years, I do not see this as a problem.  Stakeholders should consider that all invoices get reviewed prior to being paid out, so the fact that a budget is X does not mean that X gets paid out without review.  Do note that all contractor rates are location-independent, so that performing service A in location B gets paid at the same rate C across all locations.  In the context of our location-independent contractor pay and the deliverables Emilio has delivered to date and plans to deliver, this budget is reasonable.

I think it would be a massive mistake on part of the stakeholders to not approve this proposal, when you consider that Emilio has, in the context of marketing, delivered the most and cost the least.",e0dbced0786bdb34631b282811a53d7a6495c1285861374c38a46a40b08feb6ff5ab21df325b319814bb8017cfa5cc18678dd919721a9fd4f370f79e588b260a,e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360,30,c50016db7571fbc61495e7044baae6e9260d8c56c5ef29fa0c1f770b4bc432b600e0f8527b526caf97ce5fc94dd0c467e4ef709e01433ceb752357cfc5ef0c0a,1585061635,6,7.0,False,fe62dd6a-2cc6-4d41-abd0-522528d33ae7,jy-p,1.0

Well, I would never doubt that information. I live in Brazil and that is why I know that everything here is very cheap in relation to the dollar. So, it's just expected that the cost will be a fraction of what is spent in developed and more expensive countries.

> as if metrics from centralized pro-censorship tech giant websites is the only way to judge output.

I agree with you that social media metrics are not very important, but it was Emilio himself who used them in the proposal. I just contested them.

> The project has more BR devs than from any other nation state besides US. If it were not for C0, BR would have the most devs.
The BR devs are honest, hard-working, and easy to get along with. They have taken the initiative in many cases and now are leads on several repositories, e.g. decrediton, politeiagui, pi-ui, dcrlnd, and other LN repos.

The Brazilian community is really big, as I made clear in my comment. And much of its early development is due to Emilio. But what is being questioned here are the metrics (for example, number of members in the facebook group) as a mean of measuring the growth or maintenance of the community. Kudos to all brazilian devs for their great work with DCR!

> Decred has had a presence at major BR cryptocurrency events for several years at this point. I have attended 2 conferences in BR in Q2 2018 (Bitconf in SP) and Q1 2019 (Campus Party in SP). At Bitconf, the crowd was roughly 200 people, and at Campus Party, it was roughly 100 people.

Bitconf was once a great event, I just ask you to check with [all of the Brazilian community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bitcoin.brasil.2/) (and not just one person and their select group of friends) on what this event has become and how it has harmed the entire Brazilian cryptocurrency ecosystem.

> Do note that all contractor rates are location-independent, so that performing service A in location B gets paid at the same rate C across all locations.

This makes perfect sense for jobs that can be done remotely (like devs). But events and hours worked on events must be based on the local cost of living for certain reasons: if you pay the same price (in USD) for an event in Brazil and an event in the USA, it is clear that the quality of the second will be much worse , since everything in the second is more expensive.",8c5007e194aa2945096b2d7dad0da702928fb0626676df0696df3b49c58ea14e80225319669e09753d28ee2574d5e173b1d0bfcb71b5c7f9c187bf57d0300d0a,b03f1fa0738263fcf987b74359068b78e8f46dd323b7d738874a0820e4bc8528,53,a224bd26d6f4006887aa0fd94c21385ec9bf669f5514675361b4b63afb8a248098afcfa7cd04bb5783817a690a4f706853061dae5bd10b0a6a4b22d3d8969e0d,1585082185,1,2.0,False,ab519bd1-0f61-43bb-aeaf-9d62cb43288f,brasildecred,1.0

You made a bunch of claims and almost didn't post any links to support them.

The reason is important here. It is unfortunate that you don't have the details and surprising that you are 'sure' about something. What if he is wanted because he 1) controls a large cryptocurrency group on a platform not controlled by BR authorities and 2) is not anonymous?

And why do you provide this additional detail if you don't know the details?

6,c830ea5afea45a0aabf4092d1bea51fb10b8bfa2d8474aac03224f0f94d3d1af,0,"I am not comfortable supporting this proposal currently.

I first want to acknowledge and express my appreciation for the comms engine that dustorf and others have built. It is remarkable.  I don't read the Journal all the time, but when I do, it's solid. Worthy of being the flagship.

The community organizer portion of this proposal may need to be reconsidered in light of Covid, even though it hurts me to say that since events can achieve very high returns on marketing spend when executed and measured effectively.

This brings me to the primary concern I have with the overall proposal. 

And it's actually a common thread in most DCR marketing proposals (e.g. Brazil, Europe, 2019 marketing and events). 

As a stakeholder, I ultimately want to have the same level of confidence in the value that the community gets from the DCR marketing spend as we have in the integrity of the DCR chain.  

That may be unrealistic today, I realize, but that's a worthy goal (and arguably non-negotiable) to effectively enable a truly decentralized marketing organization, particularly one that has global ambitions.

The challenge I have with all of these marketing proposals is that I don't see  any type of rhythm around reporting or even target metrics. That's a symptom. The disease is lack of accountability.

We may want to ""build awareness of Decred and develop tools"", but a year from now in the 2021 budgeting discussion, how will stakeholders know whether the investment moved the needle or not?  While we're at it, how will we know a quarter or a month from now?

Awareness can also mean different things to different people as well, so a clear target would prevent misunderstanding. It would also reduce grumbling along the way. 

Lastly, I'm not 100% clear why Decred needs a Jan 1-Jan 1 marketing budgeting process. But that's a different point.

The 2019 marketing report by dustorf reinforces some of these concerns.  

While there are some legitimate wins and a proven ability to execute against content, it's not clear to me how the 785k USD benefited the community in a concrete way. 

It's no one's fault, since no one really brought it up in the proposal stage the year before. It's hard to have any type of accountability in a marketing org (centralized or decentralized) if you don't set the high-level goals at all.

Even after multiple pages in, I know what was spent in 2019 (which is great, assuming it's accurate), but I didn't see any helpful marketing metrics to help me assess the impact of these outlays.

If none, then we can call it ""learning,"" which is fine,  particularly for an ecosystem this young. However, I am not clear what the guidance should be after discovering that ""Decred T-shirts provide good branding around an event.""

Furthermore, I am confused by the state of the PR function.  

The 2019 report highlighted a Positive as ""Decred experimented with competitive pitch / hired Ditto PR (highly engaged Politeia proposal)."" However, the 2020 proposal indicates that MondePR is the new firm.  Back in my marketing days, it would easily take 2-3 months to really get a PR firm (of any quality) up to speed.  Maybe I'm old and slow, but even so, that's low ROI on a PR team investment, imho.  Unless Decred has two PR firms, which seems like overkill. 

It just sounds more like it should be a negative. I certainly can relate to that. World-class PR is notoriously difficult to find and I got it wrong more than once.

What I see in all of these proposals is a passionate commitment to Decred and a lot of activity. Much of it is, I am sure, very good and undoubtedly genuine value for the money.

What is missing for me, and which would help me make a more informed and educated decision about whether to support a marketing proposal or not, is for the proposal submitters to not confuse the high-level execution of marketing activities with the desired outcomes of the community.

I think a marketing proposal should force that conversation by suggesting a few that could be indicative of success (hopefully!) or failure. 

At the same time, I think the community needs to take an active role is helping to set the proper marketing goals to reflect the desired outcome (e.g. build awareness).",e3d7de035a0c874553addad2dfaf0038b07081e0bad6d1c50e63b6aef57a7725131b717dba8b4f18f6f1f3b641262d645650618946cd54776f48ef86ec7e4507,947e2d3d5ed7dfaff737bb90163b46d68d7dafe02c31566184af2c71b224b2e7,15,e446cb4e70e7328c65109d1c45416f008e745369ef03f1810b2ff31152a262fd1ede3e29e3ebaddde4a22bdacac6aba1afa5f71a3d34ffb17eeb3dfec615a209,1583960695,6,6.0,False,2200f65d-0fe9-43f7-b2f4-369a41b2357f,jer979,

Here is my reasoning which is through my own experience and witnessing others. I believe what marketing is, is planting seeds so to speak. Along with planting seeds, every person needs a different number of seeds to be planted in them to win them over (meaning they invest/join). The quality of presentation can be seen as how many seeds are being planted in each person in that one session. So lets say it was a good presentation, 5 seeds were planted in everyone. Well John needs 10 seeds, Susie needs 20, Bob only needed 5. Therefore Bob has joined the community, John is halfway there (he will probably join when he hears the news that the DEX is released, that will be worth another 5). And Susie needs the presentation+the DEX+ price to go up+her trusted friend to recommend it to her to meet her quota of 20 seeds....Now for my personal experience. I came from the Digibyte community. Jared the founder occasionally listed DCR as a solid coin. I kept seeing that. Also on twitter a trusted person I followed kept harping on how great DCR was (this went on for months) but hey, I was happy with DGB so I didn't give it much of a look (this could be the equivalent of doing marketing and no one joining, it feels like a failure, but there was still value transferred). It wasn't until I came across Checkmate's material that made me jump in. I wouldn't have jumped in so fast and hard if the previous seeds weren't planted, I wouldn't have trusted it enough. I think marketing starts the lindy curve so to speak. The name gets out there, people hear it and just based on that, I think it starts to be trusted kinda like how a politician has a much greater chance of being elected if people recognize their name.",111fc037664033063925707b5c7a2dde05a4cbd8ad15067bac2b29df184642736cb2bef2af7fc2bc8718b51d8385826bed9226a81dddb1776f08e2f607ff2709,9104b1853e1097fbd14d13018a9a51c537c16d173cda56ae91166e2dd27fe04d,16,6a5f65c21fa12720b7cc43f5613aa5ac0f4168049c7d73b3ba33db791038cfa108c35dbd66f591c1b03234b273fc96d1c4f6bd76cc54a442b7f47d5a09b17e0f,1583976426,5,5.0,False,067b690e-c042-4107-8c5f-d6873b0f6bf5,wd28,

I appreciate the thoughtfulness and constructive approach. I agree that measuring and setting goals is the best way to go, and I would be more than happy to add these to the proposal so long as the community agrees to what they are and how they are measured. Follower counts on all social media and communications platforms are reported monthly in the Decred Journal. Internally, we do follow and track the project's twitter account performance. We also know that roughly 43% of the followers are not legitimate. YouTube and social platforms have their own metrics: impressions/views, reads, likes, shares, etc., but the community tends to be skeptical that these metrics can be easily gamed or manipulated. Additionally, each new convert is not equal. The addition of a developer might be more valuable than a passive holder. Something brought richard red, checkmatey, degeri and others into the project. The collective thinking here is that the creation of quality content that serves Decred's mission we beget more quality contributors and establish a narrative of what it means to be part of Decred. Perhaps you could share specific ideas for metrics and we could agree on what they should be. r/decred on Reddit is probably a good spot for that.

Regarding Lindsey from Monde coming up to speed quickly, you're correct to think that this is unusual. It's been possible because she was a contractor back in 2017 and knows the project well, plus we have done a decent job documenting messaging, stories, topics, and more on GitHub. https://github.com/decredcommunity/pr",82f126469984b9c96001dbe38839a9168bbb67118a791cfae6dafd8694b9af59abe9255323dbc8d064698aaf6b49cf9f8bb25236d3289ce9840f39ddd4b38a00,f3f7cc551f53c4532026f57a27477e7c057b15ce55d093f5129971a7bcfac087,19,bfa5a1ebf2c0f40f5b55b437509dbbef313b9b2cf9bb994c02ec2a77e59c078b16f63dda7c28082c6bf9527ba819802c284382e47151786d7df0dce493bcf50c,1584041950,2,2.0,False,c2adc10c-375d-4399-a4b7-0fbbc827034d,dustorf,

I think it is wise to embrace a more decentralized marketing effort, where different people and groups develop their own takes on Decred and explain what it means to them in a way that their peers will understand. This is very much the natural approach for the Decred community to take, because trying to enforce adherence to particular messaging would be at odds with how contributors usually relate to each other. Embracing the ""headless brand"" is a natural progression for Decred.

I appreciate the detail on the budget and all of the line items seem reasonable to me, everything covered by this proposal is valuable and produced to a high standard, in my estimation. Good call on the cost cutting for Decred Assembly.

As someone who works on some of the aspects of this proposal, thanks for putting together a proposal that covers these smaller sub-projects, so that the rest of us can focus on our respective pieces of the larger effort!

I gave a figure of $450/month for the last 6 months, what more do you need?

They do indeed take more than 1 hour per article to write. To convey what happens with a proposal over the course of a week or two means reading it in depth, maybe multiple versions to track changes as that is a particular weak point of the user experience. Although the interface handles it well, it is fundamentally difficult to follow a conversation where the proposal evolved over time. I also read the comments and try to give a reasonable account of how people commented and voted. 

Whether this is worth doing is up for debate. At the start there were some shortcomings in the information available about proposals and I was mostly using Pi digest to plug gaps. Over time most of the important information has become available through the proposals site itself and also dcrdata, so Pi digest is less needed for that kind of purpose. I think the summaries of proposals and their comments are useful for stakeholders who do not have the time to follow proposals in depth, or at least that is my motivation for doing it. Keeping the digest concise is one of the aims, but just because something is short doesn't mean it can be written very quickly.

Having said that, Politeia Digest is not usually one of the more compelling things for me to work on, so I won't be put out if community members think I should stop doing it.

I agree w/you about the gaming of metrics as a risk. No question that is a point of vulnerability.

If the community is satisfied with marketing expenditures based on the assumption of  ""the creation of quality content that serves Decred's mission we beget more quality contributors and establish a narrative of what it means to be part of Decred,"" that's fine with me. 

It's not a bad premise. All I am saying is, next year, after your team creates more quality content,  what kind of ""begetting"" are we hoping for to assess whether the effort yielded positive results?

As for specific metrics, if I spent a few hours w/you or someone else who is more immersed in DCR, we could probably come up with some for initial proposal for the community to assess and debate.  You rightly point out the need for the  community  to agree ""to what they are and how they are measured.""

A simple exercise for you and the community might be: 
A year from now, how will we know we have grown in terms of market awareness, perception, and membership?

If I had to guess, I think some of the marketing metrics of a crypto network will come down to how wallets and tokens ""behave.""  
For example, are more people staking/voting?
Are new wallets getting created that then acquire new tokens?

Alternatively, 
Are new Dapps getting created? Are they being used?
New integrations?

On a different vector, are there more GitHub commits from more people?

I'm sure some of these can be gamed, but those are some initial thoughts. I'll think more.

I did write an e-book on Decentralized Marketing Organizations. Perhaps there are some nuggets in there (but probably not!)

The Decred Journal is expensive to produce because it's essentially an internal news department that aggregates all the information and makes editorial decisions about what qualifies, what doesn't, and what gets pushed to the top.  bee has an established outline that he clones for each new month, and an image is requested of the design team. Contributors track the various categories throughout the month, adding meat to the bones of the working document on GitHub. Once the month is over, the work moves into overdrive, when all the aggregated figures for developer activity are added and editorial decisions are made. Documentation for contributors can be found here: https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/contributing.md

The total costs in the proposal include all translations, which have been narrowed over time.

This proposal has been revised to be pretty austere already. If this doesn't pass, there's a danger Decred loses a good chunk of its community.

Any marketing effort in this environment, frankly, feels like wasted.  

This is in no way a reflection of the fine work Dustorf and Co have been doing so far, just to get that out of the way.

It would seem that spending precious Treasury funds at the present DCR/USD rates on substantial content generation, i.e. work that goes beyond regular dev/community/research updates that display that the project is alive and well and is relentlessly marching forward in developing the Decred family of technologies is hard to justify.  The project should tighten the belt and keep the ammo for the time when the fog clears in the CC space and there will again be a receptive audience for more sophisticated content.

What I would like to see is a streamlined, austere, no-frills content generation effort for the foreseeable future at a significantly lower monthly cost than indicated in this proposal.  Once we begin to hear the crypto bull roar from a distance, let's ramp up the PR & marketing again - but until then I don't see the point of spending this kind of cash on blowing in the wind.  

The proposal in its current form is gets a NAY from me.

As this pandemic plays out, the legacy financial system will demonstrate exactly what it did in 2008, except that this time the bailouts are built-in and foregone. A precedent has been set, and every corporation will be made whole. Currently, a universal basic income is being put forth-a new entitlement that will not be revoked. This will be massively larger than 2008, and nothing will ever be the same.

The legacy system is proving that it is systemically built to fail. I agree that attention is currently on the health crisis, but once that situation gets settled or becomes the new normal, a flood of people will become interested in this new form of money that brings with it a deterministic supply and a new way to organize people and assets.

### Liked

- Glad to see Decred in Depth continue. I could only listen ~8 episodes but liked them all. It is a good resource to learn about the project _and people_ behind it, most content will stay relevant for years, and the audio format is flexible.
- Glad to see Decred Drive getting funded! DecredDragon has proven his commitment and self-managed a consistent stream of releases.
- I like that this proposal includes expenses since Jan 1st. This way there is no period of expenses that go unvoted. Ideally we would not have a weird situation where we vote for past expenses, but it is better to vote and express my opinion after the fact, rather than having no vote for them at all and be uncomfortable about that.
- I'm sad about canceling university outreach but it's the right thing to do right now. Glad it was considered anyway. Perhaps we can find other ways to get there (e.g. contribute to online blockchain courses?).
- Appreciate cutting the costs.
- As a DJ writer I thank you for the trust and for funding our work.

### Not liked

- The lack of any reporting commitment specified in the proposal (more on that below).
- I'm not too excited about ""Original Content Generation"" item. The [linked posts](https://medium.com/@dlefebvr) are not bad but 2K/piece looks overpriced for their size. The [2019 marketing report](https://blog.decred.org/2020/02/26/Decred-2019-Marketing-Report/) is perhaps worth 2K but it is much bigger.
- If one newsletter issue is only top 5-10 stories, simplified for casual reader, and is based on other content, $500/piece looks overpriced. Unless each piece includes unique image design, which I think it should not.

### Questions

- Can you please elaborate why Monde PR needs a 1K/month management overhead in addition to its 3.5K/month base cost? We often talk about how our contractors must self-manage so I'm a bit confused about this.
- To what extent this proposal can fund DJ translations? Are all translations getting funded? What was the past spend on translations and what is projected for 2020, given that the amount of translations [fluctuates](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) each month?
- Is it possible to have the keynotes files available outside of the proprietary Notion platform? In what format are they stored there?
- Does ""Updates to websites"" include web development costs or only content updates (i.e. text and graphics)?
- Can you please give a hint on how coordinating one release consumes 6K?
- What are some example deliverables included in ""Marketing Updates""? It lists keynotes, business brief and the website but it's not clear to me how that takes 20K.
- Since this proposal includes expenses that already took place since Jan 1 (which I like), what would we do about these expenses if the proposal is rejected?
- I would appreciate if you could answer the [questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/fa70c3/decred_2019_marketing_report/fkyq6g9/) I posted in the 2019 report discussion. I'm confused about some expenses and it would be great to clear that up before I vote on this one.

### Notes

> Decred Journal: A team of roughly one dozen community members, currently led by @bee.

To clarify, the current set of ""core"" contributors doing most of the work is 5 people. This is not to downplay all other contributions, but rather to avoid overpromising on the decentralization. I'd love to have [a few more](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/contributing.md) people who can translate the dev logs to English and take some other tasks.

### Recommendations

1\. Monthly progress and expense reports.

I would really like to see them as part of this and all other proposals. I don't want to be in the dark until missing accountability features are implemented in CMS and Politeia. They were [criticized](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/591#issuecomment-485869331) earlier, now they seem to be understaffed and have low priority and may take many more months to deploy. After 1.5 years of Politeia's operation and millions of dollars approved we still don't have basic reporting and accountability tools in Pi, and the proposal owners in general seem to not have the ""inner urge"" to consistently report to the stakeholders.

I agree with jer979 that ""The disease is lack of accountability"". I believe we can cure it and it's not so hard once you get used to it. I wrote more on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/fa70c3/decred_2019_marketing_report/fkyqomn/). It is my fault that I didn't post this earlier when it was still possible to edit the proposal but nothing stops from adopting this approach regardless. We can use the [proposals](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals) repository until Pi gets the missing features.

Note that this is different from what we put in DJ, because DJ tries to cover _all_ marketing activity without specifying which proposal it is funded by, if any.

2\. Prepare the yearly report and the 2021 proposal earlier to minimize the amount of time we're running on unapproved funds. The schedule could look like:

- throughout each month: throw notes into draft report
- end of each month: publish monthly report
- early December: start yearly report based on monthly reports (it's easier when you don't start from scratch)
- early December: start drafting and iterating next proposal
- late December: add things happened in December, finalize report, publish
- late December: publish 2021 proposal after the report, give ~2 weeks to discuss
- ideally the vote should end by ~mid Jan

The short version is that DJ is expensive because it has a lot of stuff, has high quality requirements, takes a lot of hours to produce and uses not the cheapest labor.

One expensive part of DJ is the Development section. It requires some dev-expertise hours to distill a dozen Git repositories, compile what's happening there and translate to English that is semi-readable by non-developers.

Another thing adding to the cost is our discipline of checking facts, always linking to source (an average issue has more than 200 links!), and reviewing multiple times before releasing.

To get an idea of how each issue is produced you can read our extensive [production guidelines](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/guidelines.md).

Over time we've removed some parts that are tedious and yield little value, like the the index of interesting chats that was present in earlier issues.

Speaking of automation, we use the [contributor tracking](https://github.com/degeri/decred_contributor_track) tool to detect new people. I don't know if it is done with DJ budget, but in any case I don't think it costs too much. Other than that I'm not aware of any dev work billed as DJ. If anyone is willing to help with automation, we have a [content outline](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/content.md) that marks such opportunities. Some parts of DJ are incrementally made easier by improvements in dcrdata, and I [submitted](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/1214) a few requests of missing features. But that is funded by the currently-informal dev budget.

Mind that DJ leverages a lot of knowledge accumulated by its contributors over the yeras and a lot of time they spend in Decred spaces (of which a lot is not billed). Personally I revise my hours before billing and often cut a bunch if I feel I was less productive, which wouldn't happen on a regular job.

DJ is indeed not cheap. I hope it is worth it and I'm always listening to feedback, be it positive or negative, to further fine-tune the production.",451b1cd8392615169d937118eb45d0d3c2f70c4d019fdfba88cfa9c318fcae0b9e9cbd423c08900eeebfd3ef53a01fc0707734834db1acf91ae3d1c148eed803,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,42,3dd399d42eebaf894cfaf49b140ed362eac918de63292ef7b84dc57613fc2f8065d1f85ea50926698773b5eac874d0489f3a38a6f2f3b7c8543d38cf39b2f207,1584735692,3,3.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

I'll add to richardred's comments that:

- The level of skill and knoweldge utilized to produce those is above average. I don't know exact numbers but I assume this labor also costs more than average. Quite fairly, IMO.
- I guess the price is fair and richardred would earn more doing same kind of work on a normal job in a developed country.
- It is shorter when there's little activity and longer when there's more activity. For example [issue 27](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue027/) covers more stuff and is longer than the one you linked. Some issues like [21](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue021/) even include analysis and charts. The [issue](https://medium.com/politeia-digest/issue-28-feb-12-mar-1-2020-8e78bc0888a4) you linked happens to be 3rd smallest issue ever and about half of the historical average size. But because of hourly billing, small issues like this are cheaper than the average figure provided.
- Note that $750 per issue is a convenient limit to accomodate more work if it happens, but any not done work is not billed.
- It is an open market. If someone shows up and offers to produce the same coverage but cheaper, Politeia Digest will have to compete or shut down.",63563a4eaa26f7b7d2dfeae1a7c28f77726faec6616772d68a145edac007180d134a1ba8ffc7056d7f0e70e6496b16d6899a959f0bd8fbf4f6689c8a2c520805,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,43,8df78f004229c9a586384a2b934397cff0065e4251fcbcf292477146356623f3244b1318ac7bfb06d8aba198c58f126e6b19cef9d8f325e0dc83019d75fd9809,1584735901,1,2.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,1.0

Market stats like volume can be spoofed.

But we do need to find working metrics. Some ideas for quarterly/yearly metrics:

- The number of organizations (and people working in them) and individuals who adopted DCR as a medium to receive donations and funding, based on their alignment with Decred values. (This is in line with my [argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/fa70c3/decred_2019_marketing_report/fkyqrl3/) for adding MoE and money to our message, because I believe the non-speculative adoption starts with people making the conscious choise to accept DCR for their work and products)
- Amount of software and services that integrated Decred and their significance (partly measured by their reported user counts and amount of service rendered).
- Counts of contributors joined/left Decred.
- Amount of full nodes serving the network _and_ lighweight client nodes using DCR. We need some monitoring tools to get that data. Here's an [open issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/1214), feel free to comment to show higher demand for it.

Based on cost alone,  the amount of content created with all the journals/digests/podcasts/videos is monumental.  The production output of the people involved is impressive and I don't know of any CC or ""traditional"" project, that can have that much work done by quality people at that price.

On a different note, I know the DCR trading price will always be part of the equation and that when it's low, choices will be harder, especially for marketing efforts and community Organizing. However I take my ""job"" as a stakeholder very seriously,  and I feel the content enabled by this proposal is essential in order to keep myself up to date with everything going on in the project. It's the most open and transparent view of all things Decred and there is no alternatives IMO. In fact, it's something most projects can only dream to have.

- The Politeia Digest seems [rather short](https://medium.com/politeia-digest/issue-28-feb-12-mar-1-2020-8e78bc0888a4?source=collection_home---6------0-----------------------), just a few paragraphs, how could that cost $750? This is like a 2017 ICO level payment for a short article. 

- What is the advantage of hiring a studio for the In Depth episodes, in your opinion? Is doing it in a studio versus just having Skype calls like the old Assembly worth it for the cost? While it's nice and all, I'm not sure I find it necessary. 

- Similarly, what is the original content generation that costs $2k per article, could you expand on that a little bit? Could you break this down to explain the cost?

- Are the songs that are produced for DCR included in this, and what is the cost for each song (I mean the hip hop tracks etc. I wonder why that is missing from the breakdown)?

- iirc you chose to cancel some event due to coronavirus, understandably, so do you think the LATAM & BR & other future Proposal should consider doing something similar? With the current situations, large events with many people are dubious

I think this proposal is much needed to give more autonomy to Decred contractors in Europe, which should be of high importance for the project growth. 

I remember that during 2019 there were several events/meetups where the European contractors participated, maybe having a list of these events would be useful to understand better the importance of Europe in the context of Decred growth. I look forward to know more what happen in Europe last year.

This proposal is a team effort, to prevent voters from having to deal with multiple independent contractors who submit proposals to fund their events or marketing efforts individually. 

What will happen is a continuation of what you have already seen: independent contractors who attend and organize events to represent Decred in their local crypto communities. There are several contractors who have proven to be capable of doing this type of work, and this proposal aims to empower them without micromanaging their every move.

Crypto projects already use layered approaches for technical scalability, eg Lightning Network.  We need to think of similar layered approaches to governance, where we can move smaller decisions off Politeia as Decred grows.

This group of people have already proven to be great community members, and the proposed approach will allow for better  coordination and a more cogent narrative.

I do have a question. The proposal as written reads like there’s $50k (or close to it) going towards one conference.  Was this meant to be multiple events, with the Web Summit being a big example?

I fully support the plan to decentralize marketing efforts using multiple proposals and I like the flexibility that this proposal can offer for Europe-based contributors.

One challenge with multiple marketing proposals is that without due accounting and presentation there is a chance to spend too much. I don't mean this as an argument against this proposal, but noting that such decentralization requires extra tracking/reporting tools for everybody to see the big picture. Specifically, I would be cautious about approving more than total $500K for 2020 marketing, seeing the results of $800K+ in 2019 (and we don't really know how much was really spent).

> marketing, user support, creation of English content and local translations, community outreach, and – perhaps most importantly - local events.

User support is critical and to me the most important item in this list. It serves people already interested in Decred enough to install the software and dive into the complexities of crypto. But is it good to mix user support into area-local marketing proposal? It often happens via the Internet and is not bound to location. Perhaps there should be a separate budget for all contributors who consistently provide support. Curious what you think.

I'm happy to see Web Summit removed from this proposal. While some footage from WS 2019 was posted on social media, I was disappointed to see no report with expenses, gains and reflections for one of the biggest events of 2019.

Looking at increasing marketing expenses I'm not feeling the impact of spending on large events. It's a good idea to stop including them in these bulk proposals and vote on them separately to see what the stakeholders think.

Also, instead of ""prestige""/crypto-echo-chamber/ICO-valley/""Blockchain Everything!"" type of events I would rather spend on [hacker events](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/83) like the CCC, ideally with some dev presence. I guess staffing will be a challenge but it looks worthwhile.

Speaking of big and small events in general, over time I become skeptical about funding them as I don't see too much tangible outputs. By that I mean any noticeable number or quality of contributors or users or investors onboarded via these events, any significant local action covered (or omitted) by the media, or a spike of social media activity from users in visited locations. An interesting indicator would be an increase of support requests from visited locations (this would prove real use). A made-up example of a perfect follow-up after the event: ""5 ambassadors attended event X spending $30K. The event was attended by 5K people. Decred team engaged with 200 people. After the event, we are aware that at least 20 users were onboarded, including 1 contributor"". I'd like to see a few stories from people who got involved with Decred after local events. Of course my awareness is limited and I'd be happy to be wrong on this.

Other notes:

- The budget for smaller events is reasonable and doesn't include any big events.
- The total amount is fair and I'd like to see a similar ~$50K yearly cap for marketing in all regions.
- I'm okay with this proposal not having an exhausting list of deliverables as long as it will report as they happen, preferrably once a month.
- Appreciate the 2-week time window for the discussion.
- I recommend to pay attention to timing at the end of the year and start preparing the report and the next proposal sooner to have an uniterrupted funding for marketing operations.",a60a5189fd78ea793ffe43a7c6de41d51d01c6aa098401cc848606817a4d592c0e0fd8915ddcb2e745554d09d8af114be8615bf8da62b6d55d5f9f1bd2c1810a,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,21,28fbdcdb6f1468847b014b220dfbbaa68c3285e87b681967dd9436696bbe723ef98378445c91257990b7e35191030949015a4bca4246e7567608926e56c8de06,1582568029,3,3.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

A separate budget for all contributors who consistently provide support is a good idea, I would support that (pun intended). The main reason I included support in this proposal is because it was included in the Latam one, and because people often write me in private (via Telegram, Twitter or Whatsapp) to ask questions about Decred and its software. Support questions may be personal, so I'm guessing people prefer contacting a human being they deem trustworthy rather than asking in public chats. Decred ambassadors like myself are recognizable and are therefore a logical point-of-contact. As long as there is no global user support budget, I think it should be included in these local proposals.

You appear to assume that voters having to deal with multiple independent contractors is bad. How do you know it's bad? Is voters having to deal with contractors bad, or is the Decred proposal software bad? Is the best possible solution having a middleman that disperses these funds, or is it to have a better funding process and better software?

I am most certainly on board with it as well.  I don't understand why, with 2 days left for voting, that this proposal is likely going to receive a 'NO' vote.  The Web Summit has been removed from the proposal at the request of some stakeholders so we're left with a proposed budget of $49,000 so that Decred ambassadors can do their work across Europe .  First of all, a $49,000 allocation for multiple ambassadors in Europe to generate content, education and promotions, attend conferences/developer meetups and covering their travel/accommodations is beyond modest.  These are proven ambassadors that have already received contractor clearance.  As is stated in the proposal, their work is subject to review and approval by the global Marketing and Events team, and there is a back end safeguard in place whereby an ambassador that does work deemed to be subpar will not be paid.  

The proposal lays out a framework within which these proven ambassadors can get out there in Europe over the next 10 months and operate with the level of autonomy that they've  been accustomed to and that is necessary, in my opinion, for this type of work.  And then their work is subject to review and approval at time of payment thus they are incentivized to continue to do the kind of quality work they've already done in years past or risk not receiving payment.  

So if voting ends and this proposal does indeed receive a 'NO' vote.  What then is the plan with regard to ambassadors doing marketing work across Europe?  Does this community prefer that each ambassador submit their own individual budget proposal with an itemized breakdown as to how they will use every bit of funding?  If so, it is my opinion that such an approach will hamstring the work of ambassadors and will result in less ambassadors willing to take on the job when their work and expenditures will come under an unnecessarily high level of scrutiny.

At the end of the day, we're talking about 50k here for something that's absolutely necessary.  The effectiveness of marketing is an elusive metric and oftentimes it may seem as if it isn't working or bringing in the desired result.  But it works best when its done with consistent persistence over long time periods.  This is how brand awareness is achieved in marketing. 

  This is a competitive market now.  Decred has competitors and more will come.  While I believe Decred is a sleeping giant with massive potential, there is certainly a risk that the community could inadvertently prevent that giant from waking if it doesn't allow for aggressive, consistent and persistent marketing campaigns to be deployed via the type of streamlined, discretionary budgeting outlined in this proposal.

Carte blanche is a blank checkque, open-ended, unlimited discretionary power. To date, successful proposal creators have strove to provide clear details and examples for their work. Even unsuccessful proposals have tried to make their best case, even while failing. This proposal appears to be taking an aggressive stance against the stakeholders, going as far as to tell them to vote against the proposal if they are not willing to accept it on the appeal to authority of the names given. Transparency and openness about deliverables, which is necessary for collaboration, is equated with micromanaging. This puts the stakeholders in a few difficult positions. Stakeholders are expected to make this decision without clear details about the work. This would set a bad precedent for how proposal owners should make their best case. The proposal passing could be net positive for decred in terms of the work it could yield, but the information making the case for this is not being shown. Stakeholders would have to reduce requirements and be more experimental in order to see what the proposal yields without being given clear details. If information about deliverables is being refused from the outset, it likely follows that the necessary information would not be disclosed in the future. While much of our collective process is still coming online, I am concerned about precedents for the future that would be set on politeia.

I'm sorry but $49k for multiple, proven ambassadors to do their work across a continent for 10 months is beyond modest and will likely be constraining enough as it is for these ambassadors to pull it off at that price point. the only precedent that will be set here is that the decision to decentralize marketing decisions led to decred ambassadors being sidelined in Europe due to stakeholders requesting overly detailed information on deliverables.  some proposals likely require total transparency and openness about deliverables.  that can't always be the case and it isn't here.    there has to be some level of delegation to those that work in a specific field, especially an industry like marketing where deliverables are significantly more difficult to assess in terms of their overall benefit compared to costs incurred.  

in any event, this is going to be a 'NO' vote it seems and I hope a new proposal can be submitted which may satisfy some of the concerns raised (I believe it is good to go as is).  the goal here is to get the ambassadors back out there in europe doing their work which they've done in years past.  they won't be doing that until a majority votes to pay for it and in the meantime decred misses out on further exposure in europe

I am harping on about this because I view this as a red flag for problems that may occur in the future with a system like this and because i see marketing as absolutely essential right now for decred.  at some point the community will have to come to terms with the fact that its going to be untenable to always operate with a collective unwillingness to delegate out some discretion as to budget expenditures.

It's a budget for Decred ambassadors to spend on marketing, promotion, education and events on the European continent. Last year these local budgets were included in the global [Events](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d3e7f159b9680c059a3d4b398de2c8f6627108f28b7d61a3f10397acb4b5e509) and [Marketing](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e) proposals (in total 490k), but we decided to decentralize the marketing efforts this year.

In [my response to praxis](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/6ceb278ecd96589f5c9dabcd7ce986bc58ebfe2d4dbb793dd5b21818711b453b/comments/5) I explained why we selected the Web Summit, but I'm open to selecting different events (for example [this one](https://thebitcoinreformation.com/)). This proposal is intended as a *carte blanche* for existing contractors who have delivered in the past, as well as to provide an opportunity for prospective Decred ambassadors to prove themselves. It's hard to predict how the project will develop, so I decided not to narrow down the scope. Any budget that's left at the end of the year will stay in the Treasury.

32,6ceb278ecd96589f5c9dabcd7ce986bc58ebfe2d4dbb793dd5b21818711b453b,2,Look at it this way: the proposal is to spend ~15% of last year's Marketing and Events budget on ambassador activities in Europe. If we want to go to the Web Summit - which is probably one of the most expensive conferences in Europe - about 2/3 of that will be spent on events. Of course we can decide to change the allocation of funds if the stakeholders require that. ,24ae2e59a7261e0b0e252d46a5809b0a1b418f1c98ee02f53338bc826b7825e13cb8e60f63c12a1a89ad45ad4a243e7231b52a231eda5eed4ae15bfa7decf908,a854b650432a639cacba20b1e84627418c4a408f215c76f0754748746b436da6,8,aa32cb4d7ca200de481573d42733a06dd5ca7e096e26b657b3d070f1294be580bebfd99cbc097cd92d73f96a3c4458a0e914ccd9677464f564d73e7187ff8200,1581575408,1,1.0,False,2c5bda40-90ef-4741-bd51-13c805b8b955,haon,
33,6ceb278ecd96589f5c9dabcd7ce986bc58ebfe2d4dbb793dd5b21818711b453b,7,"Thanks haon. I still feel that as a stakeholder, I still do not know what deliverables are expected from proposal aside from a few people attending conferences. How much is spent on logistics, on time, on branding, what is the breakdown here? Given this is not the first set of conference events, this information should already be on hand. Similarly, the tweets you have provided do not give stakeholders any clarity on the value delivered to Decred, simply that it occurred. What were the outcomes from past events that warrant such large expenses that would be targeted as objectives for this round? What are the lessons learned? 

Asking for a blanket $75k for Web Summit + others is an open ended bucket and I do not support this lack of clarity on the who, how, why and what.

The Decred Treasury must be treated with the utmost respect as a multi-decade long asset. I respect brevity and being concise, however the proposal in it's current format does not have transparency, past performance metrics/reports nor a breakdown of details appropriate for such a large sum of money requested. This is especially true coming from a long term group of contractors who are familiar with this process. The standard must be higher both out of respect for stakeholders, the treasury and as a benchmark for future proposals.",83007c71fa965b60233d8049a809db838ddf98878d1fb46a195a846362c440d781470e462dc7d330701aa857e9206b65df4e92a9300813ca8738238831b4870d,ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323,9,78ea40c103f9ba57c438188482b0df2765b5222e028951b251b01751ed69c38736142ee282cac3a4725fb2e14eb4bbafe1fa5868cd6a279c8991f6818cb20408,1581575550,3,3.0,False,eb486ed6-bbb3-4815-9547-599cc0f28325,_checkmate_,

- Promote the development and knowledge of artistic DCR communities.

- Create content for the development implementation of DCR media and journal.

Where do you think all the innovation and themes of society meet? Festivals, RAVES !!!

I am not asking for my festival tickets to be financed, do not worry, there are not even tickets for the festivals, that EUROTRIP, I do it with or without DCR, for that I work;), but believe me it is very different to go for pleasure and love, that for work.

Tickets are sold out since August, they sold 33,333 tickets in 2 hours :)

Do you really think this is to finance my road trip? I think we are losing many points of view ...

Of course, I can send you my CV and what can I tell you, this of the artists and culture, is too strange and rare, how to generate economy of a currency that does not exist, thanks to our Mayan ancestors who found 3.1416.

For dcrdata, it is just a process of taking me from early coding experience to enough skill to dissect dcrdata. Once I get going, it will be all good, and Richard-Red is going through the same process + have the devs to bounce ideas off.  The main mitigation is that I just wear the time taken to upskill and in lieu of data driven research during that time, I can still develop armchair philosophy concepts to keep the content and outputs consistent.

I agree, building out dcrdata charts will be a community wide benefit and I hope this will be the genesis of increased attention from outside and an attraction for new contractors.",80cebe68ea05e4c1f71639c7100d5a4e332e264b37867af255a1f7fb38f10e5dbfd91283a1665753fc8da693b4cfbca691deacd17b61f1160d19dec325a94a00,ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323,16,f4640be0f916f0427d45c7c9c98a1eee1acbdd18bbbc9ad4bf9f777e7d2b01ecbeccf7b5aebb057fad7d44c94babe9bca7fd44039eece42edb0bf024b63b250a,1580888549,2,2.0,False,eb486ed6-bbb3-4815-9547-599cc0f28325,_checkmate_,

The combination of looking at hard data and taking a more philosophical approach makes perfect sense to me, as I myself have had multiple occasions where hard data has sent me down a new philosophical rabbit hole, and viceversa. Furthermore, as somebody who has spent a substantial amount of time interacting with Checkmate, I feel very comfortable saying that he has some of the most unique insights on Decred / the crypto space at large. I very much look forward to seeing where his philosophical exploration takes the project.

Lastly - as a fellow researcher, and somebody who has found inspiration from other researchers within the project (such as RR, Ammar, Zubair, etc.), I think it is important to keep pushing the envelope on the research front. None of this research is standalone, it all is tied together and is highly complementary. On-chain analysis and philosophy is not only an emerging field within crypto, but also particularly for Decred. If we aren't going to incentivize passionate people already within the project, with a proven track record to do this kind of work - then who will?

That is all, and you have my full support hermano.

I like the idea to carry on until the budget is exhausted. Capping the budget looks more important than having a hard deadline where billing after a certain date is not allowed even if some funds remain.

I have a few questions about Phase 1:

- What would you call the most significant finding(s) of Phase 1?
- What would you call the biggest impact of Phase 1 outputs besides Twitter impressions and renewed vigor? (e.g. the papers blowing some minds and getting referenced in interesting places).
- Did phase 1 reveal any negative findings or risks for the project?

And about the dcrdata integration:

- It would be nice if dcrdata devs could explicitly comment in this proposal about their opinion/resources/estimates/plans for integrating the new metrics. If the integration will be too expensive or is not doable within a ~year, perhaps it is not wise to spend on the specs right now.
- Will this work be redundant if Messari, CoinMetrics or other research group implements the visualization of these models universally for DCR and other assets on their platforms?",4ad04585ca875dba334f8c672c02d113bdd260fea1e1395337f165df87a1a07d929191f4e4a8bc0ec360a6175ad2cbbb1203629d2d38593c885fe64b69780100,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,38,1d01755cde7bb115a17e0d517377cb27a25708cc27563d290bd5ca97c3a70afed49f912b621c666677edd69a06cfe393b6f58aeeaf799dac9ace36aaaa864906,1582036323,1,1.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

- Most significant findings for me was the full quantification of the security budget. This certainly inspired me given the sheer magnitude of settlement finality in such a compact package. This puts Decred squarely front and center as one of the most powerful blockchains, with growth, it will surpass Bitcoin.
- Biggest impact is the number of people sharing the papers. I'm amazed, so many folks display not only confident positions in debate but they have learned from my work. Having more educated people come out the other end makes every single atom worth it for me on a personal level, education is where I derive the energy.
- Phase 1 paper 3 did reveal that adoption is quite sluggish, something I believe we are all aware of. Decred needs attention because it can handle orders of magnitude more people than it does currently. This ultimately manifests as poor liquidity which impacts negatively the SoV properties.

RE dcrdata:
- Agree, even if dcrdata is expected to take too long due to resource constraints, I will follow this up with an alternative website I manage as it has been a long term goal. Either way, the charts will go live!
- I don't think so. Decred has always been a self sufficient beast, its part of the holistic design ethos. We already see Decred excluded from many studies because it is not as simple as just pure PoW or PoS and takes grey matter to populate standard templates.

I can't believe it is seriously written there, while It costs 0.01$ per subscriber to get subscribers in the social networks. I'm not even talking about the fact that such analysis and explanation for beginners should be free, just imagine that the community of bitcoin, ethereum, or any other would pay huge money for such a thing. This raises reasonable suspicions that without paying money, no one cares about decred at all.  Omg, even if you paid these thousands dollars to someone like pewdiepie for a single repost, then the benefits for promotion and for the community would be a hundred times more.

- Exitus has been around for a long time, he knows how Decred works and is constantly learning.
- Videos are high quality and improving. I commented why on Reddit ([one](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/cveuuu/the_feeless_decred_dex_has_been_approved/) [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/dktucx/new_video_year_1_review_of_politeia_decreds/) [three](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/eq62t9/is_a_public_relations_firm_worth_it_decred/)) but in short: they are to the point, have no bloat, they value my time. Decred stakeholders are special kind of target audience whose time and attention span must be utilized as efficiently as possible.
- These videos allow me to absorb a lot of updates in just a few minutes and get the big picture before I dive into details.
- Growing YouTube presence is an [much needed step](https://xaur.github.io/writings/posts/20191127-marketing-strategies.html#grow-our-social-media) in our outreach. YouTube is an important target platform with huge potential.
- Being funded by the stakeholders allows to avoid all the headaches of the unstable and selective YouTube monetization algorithms.
- The pay is fair. To be honest, I'd like to see it increase and become a competitive job offer. I think so about all current contractors. My reasoning is that, in context of the huge goals Decred has, we have quite few committed and loyal builders/creators and we should pay them well.

Ideas:

- I would appreciate if you could put the final versions of scripts on GitHub. It will be of great help for searching (you can't reliably search videos by text yet), knowledge preservation and translations.
- Put all links to referenced proposals/web pages/etc in the description to make it easy to follow up. Or even better, put a single link to script/sources file on GitHub to maintain them all from one place.
- Create a few cryptocurrency-agnostic videos covering subjects highly relevant to Decred, e.g. an overview of governance models, PoW vs PoWPoS vs PoS, debunk energy usage myths, etc. This will help to attract new people researching the space. Knowing your quality I'm sure some viewers will associate ""Decred = high quality"" over time. I think limiting crypto-general videos to ~15% is reasonable, but it can be revised if that becomes a success.
- Keep an eye on decentralized platforms competing with YouTube, for 3 reasons: 1) There have been issues with the ""YouTube algorithm"" and censorship; 2) If a better (hopefully decentralized) platform overtakes YouTube, we will be among the first content producers; 3) Decentralized project promoting other decentralized projects just makes sense.

Questions:

- When making videos, do you have ""audio-only"" experience in mind (i.e. minimizing the loss of information when listening without video)? What are your thoughts?
- Do you plan to disable ads/monetization for videos funded by the Treasury? Or will it be a choice of `decredchannel` owners?",6942727b524342e0b747dc667f88325ccd9ac5c0ba5bee2fb42f795f8dbb50748becb61f08c1ae4b7e002c1a11e1893f8bcfee1692cd27ccc55b34b4d6638f09,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,15,e5ddf68ee8fecd142006f6f62fdbe4edf7e3e1e1a7210ef2614075fffa44edbb4b71d79db4eff1f87206f2eadd6db862e21bb85be97d5622e1a106f2a9417908,1580668346,2,2.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

I think this is a great idea. I will upload scripts to Github prior to completion for others to proof-read in order to achieve maximum accuracy. I hinted at this in the 'Who' section i.e inquiring with other contractors on certain content and suggestions.

> Put all links to referenced proposals/web pages/etc in the description to make it easy to follow up. 

Yes, I will do this. I will also include time-stamps.

> Create a few cryptocurrency-agnostic videos covering subjects highly relevant to Decred

I think this falls in line with some of the research RichardRed (and others) have done regarding the Governance of other projects. It would definitely be great to be turned into a video.

> When making videos, do you have ""audio-only"" experience in mind?

Yes. The scripts will be detailed and informative enough to where viewers listening only with audio should get a lot of it. Viewing with video will still be the ideal experience, of course.

His videos on what's happening on Politeia can energize the community and bring awareness to new people: it's hard for most with 9/5 jobs, families, to keep up with everything that's going on with DCR, having a ""news channel"" that sums it up in video form is very useful to those folks!

It's this kind of video content that the average user stumbles upon via YouTube Recommendations, and this can boost adoption, and it can also help existing DCR users get a quick rundown.

Proposal is well-written and I have no objection to any part of it!

Building a successful YouTube channel is all about three things:

- **Consistency**
-  **Community** 
- **Collaboration**

They can mean different things at different times, but in general:

**Consistency**

*Keep Uploads Consistent*

Quite a lot of what you've proposed will be dictated by elements out of your control - proposals and events, both those you attend and where you receive footage. As a result this will make scheduling returning formats e.g. your Decred 101 (like the Dash education series) really important as a tentpole series that will engage existing users and work well for new arrivals - give it a simple and easy to access title for the series ""Decred 101"" and then make sure the title comes ahead and posits something that will draw the viewers curiosity, so ""Why Privacy Matters: Decred 101"" for example. Pick a time and a day and stick to it. Generally you want to upload so you catch first thing in the morning as people are getting up, lunchtime and evening. Sundays are a good day to upload longer, more in depth pieces, weekdays for more snackable stuff. Friday lunchtime is, Friday evening isn't. 

This plays to a bigger point discussed in a previous [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/063e38270b475ad680e98c12d1a48e322f4e8defe40b265272ea60c6d2202b13/comments/19) around how Decred manages an overall content calendar - aligning contractors and community members around key events and media. 

*Keep Thumbnails Consistent*

The difference between a good thumbnail and a bad one can mean the difference between a video getting 100 views and 1000. That doesn't mean clickbait thumbs but it does mean consistent, clear, well signposted videos that draw the viewer in and ensure a clear visual language. YouTube rewards channels with high engagement metrics around things like 'watch time', so that is a good measure to look for in the analytics - if you get thumbs right, when people click they should stick around. There are a bunch of guides online and also YouTube have their own [playbook](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/features/youtube-playbook/) which is updated every year - its a good place to start for best practices on things like titles, humbnails and metatagging. 

- **Community**

On YouTube - as in the world - people follow people (or characters), so having returning 'faces' on the Decred YouTube channel is important. The 'Vlogging' format you've developed on your own channel is a YouTube staple and is ideal for this kind of relationship building, but don't forget that YouTube is also about community interaction. 

Use CTAs (Calls To Action) to prompt a response in the comments ""What worry's you about privacy... leave a comment below"" and then use these community comments as inspiration for new videos in another series - kind of a long running Decred Community AMA. There are lots of incredibly smart people in the community and crypto is a scary place for most newcomers. Ensuring that Decred has educational materials that are also interactive will be a strength when built up over time. 

Decred 101 can be your show on the basics of Decred, but there might be an equivalent of Decred In Depth podcast that might be a nice format to have guests on from the Decred contractor group. On YouTube the best channels are the ones where they work together with the fans and include them in the 'show'. This openness and inclusivity is core to building engagement over the long term. 

- **Collaboration**
With the volume of content uploaded to YouTube every day are only a few ways to reach viewers:

**1. Search:** These are people who are already looking for content about Decred from the home page. For this audience it's all about Decred's YouTube channel being well organised, signposted and with clear and concise titles and thumbnails. 

**2. Embedded views:** This is when the video is embedded on an external site or publisher, or in social sites like Twitter or Facebook (though YouTube videos don't travel well on FB, their native video is best). There is a benefit to creating this Decred 101 as a trusted resource that smaller crypto publishers can start to pick up and embed over time. This means coordination with Monde PR - this is all about a long tail strategy rather than a big hit on major publications, but it can be effective if the strategy is sustained over a long period of time - which this proposal has the ability to do. Think about building a network of smaller publishers who are looking for educational materials. 

 **3. Collaborations:** All of the big YouTubers built their success on collaborations with other YouTubers. On the platform the options are so vast, that discovery is the single hardest thing to achieve. This could be an opportunity for another ongoing series where you reach out to and build conversations with projects who have active communities but are in areas with adjacent interests to the tech  stack being built by Decred. Topics like Privacy, sub- cultures like Remote work, these are communities that will be interested not just in what Decred does, but how it might help them. It might be an interesting idea to plot these potential technical / cultural adjacencies and then reach out to those YouTube channels and suggest a collaboration (Bee [mentioned this](https://xaur.github.io/writings/posts/20191127-marketing-strategies.html) at the end of his marketing strategies document). 

In a collaboration, there are generally links from one channel to the other - often there is Part 1 on one channel and then Part 2 on the second channel and the aim is to share audience. So for instance a collaboration with a YT channel focussed on personal privacy features a conversation on their channel with you - the focus is on why privacy matters... the follow on video on Decred's YouTube channel features you and the presenter from the other channel discussing how Decred's privacy implementation works. 
 
Final point which speaks to a more general strategy around YouTube. *Channels* is actually a misnomer since they really act more like *shows* - by this I mean that populating a single channel with **all** of the content about Decred means channels can become densely packed and hard to browse. Someone who came for Decred 101 might be scared off by really technical discussions around the DEX for example - it's all about profiling potential users and the purpose for their  visit and then building Decred as a *network* of channels under the same collective umbrella. Playlists help with this to a certain extent, but they also have their own limitations. Over time it would be good to see this network appear to enable specialism of individual *channels* that can better serve a specific need. 

Good luck.

My monthly goal is to deliver atleast 2 news updates (bi-weekly), 2 ""General 101"" DCR videos, and then snippets/major proposals/videos from events as they come along.

There are a few reasons I haven't planned out a concrete schedule for videos, though it primarily comes out to **being flexible**:

-  I want to align certain videos with releases of certain features/articles. For example, a video breaking down DCR's privacy would best be released alongside the actual release of privacy features in Decrediton to maximize interest/results. Same idea with the Lightning Network's release, the DEX, Research Articles, etc. We don't know exactly when these things are coming, so I don't want to trap myself by promising ""Videos A, B, and C will be released in month Y."" when in that particular month there happens to be new releases/more important topics to cover. 
- Some things I come across sporadically and have the urge to turn into a video. For example, [this snippet of Marco talking about the Dex](https://youtu.be/TNcmLrSPMRc) from 2018 I came across, and found to be great (this is how it goes for most snippets). I will be closely monitoring all forth-coming DCR media to find the best bits, some months will have more, some will have less.
- I don't know what Events looks like for this year, so I can't say for sure what videos will come from it.
- I simply listed a sample of videos I thought would be good content for people to know about DCR. A few I have begun scripting in earnest. Some community members have already come up with interesting ideas of their own, and I'd hate not to act on their ideas simply because they weren't hard scheduled in.

I have structured my proposal such that I am not receiving a fixed amount of funds every month, but rather I am billing hourly via CMS (with a hardcap in place). If fewer videos are delivered in a given month for whatever reason (e.g. it's summer, I happen to be on vacation for 2 weeks), then the treasury will simply not be billed.",adafc711ced1f575ffecb5983783449d206042282fd01cf5a43bd5f286c7fba462c7787a64677405f57aa89767a12821e830660c08c5958c8cdf79b4084f440f,988e824870740811a14e955ba8749e1f100f8cbc777af7dd3d6d9a9295646458,21,385bfb819d9291a1688eb60386f9f910195ad81e1d140c2d3649ce434934f2f2fac403378f4826dd5453929e8a90db3632a34e4a8f5def0ab3209c34e19f4004,1580884992,2,2.0,False,65706d2f-f82b-4aa5-b4eb-4b1140f4f41f,exitus,

This plays to a larger tension about Decred's values and then into what the treasury does and doesn't fund - and why. 

There's a very fuzzy line between *marketing the project* through sponsored materials (which is what you are suggesting here [rickshaw](https://proposals.decred.org/user/2db036c0-0fe3-4564-b389-a1a3b21300dc) and the treasury funding open source products and associated educational materials that are created to develop the technology for the public benefit as per the [consitution](https://docs.decred.org/governance/decred-constitution/). 

It seems to me that the unresolved conflict between what constitutes *marketing* (that is driven by the self interest of the project and its various stakeholders) and *open source product development* ( developed for the public benefit) is at the root of much of the debate on Politea and in other channels. It is exactly the reason as to why the Ditto work and recent proposal sat awkwardly for many since it felt like something that needed to be done (because that's what everyone does), but also something that was in direct conflict with the projects OSS values (which is definitely not what everyone does).  

A case in point where things get messy without absolute clarity and transparency is the recently approved research proposals from [richardred](https://proposals.decred.org/user/350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c) and [checkmatey](https://proposals.decred.org/user/eb486ed6-bbb3-4815-9547-599cc0f28325). 

Trust takes a long time to build and a minute to destroy - especially in an area like crypto. I enjoyed [Crypto Commons ](https://cryptocommons.cc/) because it did feel like genuine independent analysis and thinking in the same way I enjoyed checkmatey's recent [bear case](https://t.co/k8j2JFonVA?amp=1) debate with [Vitalik](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ewb9as/why_eth_wont_sustain_a_monetary_premium/fg1q9q7/) about  ETH sustaining a monetary premium. 

I took them both at face value as independent analysts whose lack of bias was a reason to trust their output - their continued involvedment with Decred being a signal to me that this is a place that attracts a really smart and dedicated group, which in turn makes me confident of the projects long term success. 

Where it gets messy from an outside perspective is when that role as independent researchers creating truly independent research products designed to make everyone smarter (public benefit), crosses over to being paid to research and analyse Decred's own data which are then used to provide the bull case for in investment in DCR.  The same applies with this video proposal. 

What are the lines? Where are they drawn? How is this communicated internally and externally? 

I don't claim to have the answer, but I do think it's an area that is worth more in depth conversation that crosses a wide range of perspectives. Bandaid solutions such as suggested above just serve to put off addressing the real issue which is something that has implications for literally everything the project does going forward. 

If left unresolved it just makes the job of building trust around the projects values, products and research much harder.

Content is useful when it contains accurate information and is telling something new.

Existing Decred stakeholders need to learn ""something new"" about both Decred and the world around it via research, updates and reports, in order to be aware of the situation, get smarter, and make better decisions for Decred. In case of research, I would argue that informing stakeholders for good decisions should be its top priority. Content generated for this audience also inevitably contributes to organic marketing since it is public.

Newcomers need to learn ""something new"" in terms of educational materials, in order to engage with Decred efficiently. If crafted well, this content also indirectly contributes to marketing.

People outside Decred need to be told ""something new"" to have them interested in Decred. This can be both about Decred and the world around it. I think we can call this ""marketing"" and we can say that this information helps one's decision to look or not look into Decred.

All groups above can be additionally served with Decred-agnostic research and content to make everyone smarter. This is the explicit ""public benefit"" content category, and we can say it helps everyone with their decisions in the domain the content is about.

Since Decred's [mission](https://docs.decred.org/governance/decred-constitution/) is ""to develop technology for the public benefit"", actually all of the above contribute to the public benefit, directly or indirectly.

Now, if any of the content mentioned above is made of biased or inaccurate information it will not serve its target audience and look bad on the project.",1194bce3d4fbe85dc98a5be42f5923e2e392d589f9e241c4267b9199f25c7918a1b572b65cbb5efae57917aebfa44285a71ee7836b323be5ea3e814800011e0e,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,37,a2b58bc6aaa6382d5d9f8b275fb076a5b63d00413a11a1c5cbd295e5b7cd550806fd5737fcbbd0079bd3e6b3f1ec83e823b3e3abedba773f276fe36747756503,1581522277,1,1.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

My previous videos have been well received and enjoyed by the community, so we'll see.

I suppose the only way to gauge effectiveness is off of video views and new subscribers which will be monitored. For the record, we saw in the past year:
**YouTube subscribers: 3,746 (Feb 2019) - 3960 (Feb 2020)**

Which is pretty minimal growth despite spending near 1 million dollars on Marketing/Events/Pro PR.

I believe my videos will breathe new life into DCR's YT Channel.


> When does the video content come from? Who writes what you say in the videos?

Video content will come from a number of sources. For DCR 101 videos, it will come mostly from DCR Docs, for News it'll come from the Decred Journal/Decred Drive, for proposals it'll come from the proposals themselves, for snippets it'll come from other DCR Media.

I will be doing all the writing/scripting, though I will be submitting drafts on to GitHub for other community members to audit/improve.

> How do you plan to change the creation process if the videos aren't effective?

I'm not really sure what you mean by that question. Video Creation involves Scripting/Filming/Editing - there's no way to really deviate from this. 

I believe the direction I will be taking with the videos - quick, direct, informative will be ideal for a YouTube audience. Currently much of the content on the DCR YT channel is geared towards a higher level audience and is quite lengthy. This content will be much more accessible for those new to DCR, though the News/Proposal pieces will also be of benefit to stakeholders.

> Do you plan to have a first pilot video for the community to give feedback?

As I wrote in my proposal, you should watch the [PR Proposals video](https://youtu.be/uzhc2CKI2wk) I did to get a glimpse at the content/quality to expect.

> Are you open to having the quality of videos assessed?

Yes, absolutely. Feedback and criticism is a good thing.  If someone thinks something about my videos is bad, I would hope they would tell me so it can be changed/fixed.

> Is the proposal structured in a way that penalizes you monetarily for bad videos?

Technically no, it doesn't. 

Of course, as a Stakeholder for DCR I want to put out effective content that will help DCR grow and become more valuable. Also, I would like future proposals to have a chance at being passed, so it is in my best interests to put out videos that are high quality and that the community likes.",41efc2e4d81cb87acf4c2b233787cf4770237c638e2c2601bc852efdb1c0c524e1ab74ae1a21c214ef429349412ddf8c5f2773a4ac32d2dbcf5ba5b05ca1f502,988e824870740811a14e955ba8749e1f100f8cbc777af7dd3d6d9a9295646458,40,301991d5c9c9b746a2efb07cc284010490503c92daa1d8f4c91505050ec730a2211887c065e362a6ce96a605bc30a9965f3d575cd860e5d7ce478883151c710a,1581642914,0,,False,65706d2f-f82b-4aa5-b4eb-4b1140f4f41f,exitus,

Yes, earlier videos while informative, were amateur in production value. In the past month, I have invested in equipment such as:

- Better Lighting
- A Teleprompter
- Better video editing software

This has helped improved production value as seen in the latest video. I hope to continue improving scripting, filming, and editing.

The plan all along has been for all contractors to have to go through Pi to get their funding approved. This transfer has progressed slower than some have wanted. There are a couple main reasons IMO:

1) Pi was optimized for stakeholder attention. In practice, this has meant that it has been used mainly for large budgets, such as PR, Marketing, OSS research, etc. The view among ""leadership"" generally is that smaller proposals would waste stakeholder time. 
2) Most contractors' day-to-day work is variable, and not well captured by large budgets. Contractors can work in different areas, pursue new opportunities as they arise (within reason), and may have outside commitments outside the project that limit how far out they can predict their availability. This flexibility is a big reason many contractors work on Decred in the first place, at typically below market rates (Decred gets an amazing deal on labor). It isn't possible for some to say what they'll be doing for six months, and for how many hours. If they did, the difference between a (better paying) job becomes less clear. It's kind of like a (largely) decentralized Uber for knowledge workers. Make them commit 6 months into the future, without the flexibility to pursue other opportunities outside stakeholder approval, and you could see valuable community members demand better compensation or leave the project (more likely). 

There have been discussions for how to make Pi (or alternate platfoms) more amenable to smaller, more granular projects, but these seem to have stalled out.

Great to see your proposal, I agree with you that is important to keep a strong presence in the largest social network of the world. 
I also have to recon that since I've been in the crypto space I've change many of my view on social media networks, I think Facebook sucks. 
Nonetheless, we must definitely have a strong social media account on Facebook in order to send our message to new audiences that probably are not aware of how terrible is as a platform that sucks privacy for the sake of profiting. I have mixed feelings about ads. It's against Decred ethos to track our users, and still we need to get to those potential new users that are still using centralised platforms but that could change their usage if they reflect on other possibilities. But at the same time, using ads could allow us to target our message more efficiently.

A few questions: 
- What organic strategies do you think that could be useful? 
- Do you recon a case where ads can add value? I'm thinking for example during big events like consensus or others in which we want to have a strong presence, just an idea. 

Wish you all of success!

* I believe we need to go, and be, where potential new users are even if it's not pretty. As far as organic strategies, making posts more engaging by inviting discussion is a great way to lead to new followers as they tag their friends to share their opinion or to ""get a load of this guy"" when someone shares an unpopular viewpoint. There are popular Facebook groups that exist for the sole purpose of discussing cryptocurrencies and answering new user questions and sharing new project developments. I can visit these places and promote our project, capturing interest and leading them to the rabbit hole. 

* Facebook will let you pay them to put your posts in front of more eyeballs, but it's expensive and the return on investment is very hard to measure.

2. With that decision made, it is worth considering the likelihood of success for the work contained in this proposal in order to:
  
- set realistic community expectations for what is achievable without paid media
- set out a plan that maximises the chance of creating organic sharing of content and therefore an expansion in the awareness of the project. 

**A rough history of FB's ad model. 
** 
- Phase 1  - Pages paid to get 'likes' from people who had 'liked' pages a bit like theirs. 
- Phase 2 - Pages had to pay to get content to the people who they had already paid to reach, in order to get those people to hopefully share that content onwards.  
- Phase 3 - Pages had their reach in the news feed throttled by FB. Instead the ranking algorithm prioritised sharing of content between friends / family etc. 

Nowadays organic reach is only gained through the actions of a small sample of the original post and these actions determine how far and wide the FB algo will share the content. 

So say Decred has 3000 likes (side point it would be interesting to see the data behind that that growth, assume most in 2017 run up?) then a post without paid media might reach 10% (or less). 

- So now up to 30 people who have liked the page have the post in their timelines - not all at once, but staggered through a relatively short window of time.  
- If the post demonstrates positive engagement (like, comment, share) then a larger sample will  be tested and scaled out
- This is on a post by post basis. 
- A small amount of 'pass on' equity, based on the relative performance of previous posts can improve the initial sample size of future posts - a compounding reward for consistency of engagement and of posting. 
- The type of content - text, image or video is also weighted. FB prioritises video - it results in higher engagement and there are more ad dollars to be made.  

So without paid media there are only really two strategies that are available:

1. **Create content that will be shared.** Easy to say, harder to do. Clickbait, riding the news cycle or hyping an announcement works, but this scattergun approach is hard to manage and doesn't build any long term trust in the page, hence why I'm sure many in the community are unsure of FB as a publishing destination. 
2. **Build a publishing network of pages** with adjacent interests and/or values  (e.g. they don't all have to be crypto, it's back to the idea of people who are interested in this, are also interested in that). Then build a consistent publishing schedule and cross-post and tag each other in each page. Over time a spider network grows that can help trigger more organic reach as a collective than could have been if posted alone. This is the basic network collaboration strategy behind every large FB network (and Instagram / YouTube accounts as well). 

1 can work without 2, but 2 doesn't work without 1. They work best when developed together. This approach can then kickstart people sharing content more widely with friends - and deliver organic reach. 

**In summary:** 

- Create engaging original content (that is ideally video) and then distribute that through a consistent and coordinated content plan through a growing network of like-minded pages. 

A tool like https://socialbakers.com is the type of thing that would help project manage this and enable collaboration between a large number of contributors, both internal and external. 

I don't know if there is an open source alternative. This has been discussed on another thread, but figuring out a tool that could aid individual contractors in their work and simultaneously facilitate collective content creation, management and distribution is key. 

Good luck.

Liked:

- Great effort to push transparency further, leading by your example! I'm not advocating too detailed reports or expenses. There must be a balance between contractor's privacy and reporting burden, and keeping stakeholders informed. But I appreciate that you proactively plan for it.
- Monthly limit of hours allows us to start small and evaluate results before ramping up FB outreach.
- The pay is reasonable.
- Glad to see ad spending removed. Honestly, I would vote to spend $200/month to teach people to block ads.
- Appreciate the summary of updates at the end.

Questions:

- I didn't see anyone saying that he learned about Decred via Facebook. Of course my knowledge is limited. How useful was spending resources on Facebook in the past? Did we make any noise or onboard any users/builders? Can you name a few interesting interactions?
- I suspect that FB users are the least informed in terms of cryptocurrencies and privacy, otherwise they would stop using FB. Is this the case and is it a concern for this proposal?
- Is there any significant crypto action on FB? Are many crypto projects active on FB?
- How does FB moderation feel like? What are amounts of spam and scam? Does cleaning up junk take a lot of work?
- What is the state of censoring crypto content on FB?
- I noticed an uptick in FB followers somewhere in December (from 3 to 3.2K), do you know the cause? ;)
- Can you also cover Instagram? I heard it is integrated with FB in a way that makes managing both easier.

Ideas:

- I'd like to see event expenses grouped in bigger event budgets.
- Map/analyze ""Crypto Facebook"" for the community to make a more informed decision about spending on FB in the future.
- Get in touch with several followers of our FB page to ""test it"" and learn how much Decred stuff is _really_ shown in people's feeds. FB had years and billions to excel in controlling the spread of information.
- I like the idea to try and increase our Facebook presence _for now_, but ultimately I'd like to stop feeding that platform _any data_ as soon as we're big enough. For some people that we might want to onboard, the _lack_ of FB presence could be an interesting signal.
- Participate in FB crypto discussion outside Decred page, i.e on Facebook's r/cryptocurrency if it exists.
- Try engaging with ""sound money"" communities, if any.
- Use simplified language to make Decred more accessible for people _still using Facebook_.
- Use FB's Events feature to post upcoming Decred events around the world.
- Educate users about Facebook's privacy issues. I would consider it a double win if someone both joins Decred and leaves Facebook.

Thanks for your comments bee! I'm happy to have more time to be involved again.

To answer your questions, from what I could tell during the period we did spend money advertising on Facebook, it was not very effective. I think it was the right move removing that aspect from this proposal. It's hard to gauge how many users/contributors have joined by hearing about us through Facebook. No one has stepped forward saying Facebook was where they first heard about us that I can recall. I want to change that. We do have competitors on the platform, Monero and Ethereum for example, and Facebook's dashboard allows us to follow and track their social growth in comparison to our page.

Facebook is a great place to be when there is a bull run and the uninitiated retail investors are looking for information and advice. I do think it's a mistake to write off the average person who understands Facebook uses their data to make money through advertising but enjoys the trade-off they get with the platform: staying in touch with friends and family, their favorite pages/brands, storage of photo albums and a timeline of their lives.. We don't want to be a niche cryptocurrency that is only utilized by woke sovereign individuals that disparage social media, because if that is our aim that dramatically limits the audience we can target. We want to reach as many people as possible, even if they may not have intentions beyond FOMO and greed in the beginning.

Periodically I've had to defend from scam attacks where one bot posts that Decred is doing a give-away, and a few cutouts claim that the giveaway is legit. To someone with more than two brain cells to rub together this is clearly a scam; one that most of us have seen before. I do my best to hop on and ban the users/delete the post ASAP. 

To address your other thoughts: I would be willing to help cover Instagram. I haven't much in the past, but it's a great idea to get our Instagram account more active. Facebook doesn't censor cryptocurrency content much that I can tell, at least not outside of their advertising, but it is hard to quantify how often they are showing our followers every post due to their algorithm being a moving target. More engagement leads to more people seeing the posts, that much is obvious, so it's a constant battle to try and foster engagement. I agree that once we overcome our network effect problem it may no longer make sense for treasury funded presence on Facebook or other platforms. I know I personally don't want to do this forever. I love the idea of advocates to help gauge the page's impact and helping spread reach and foster engagement. I don't believe anyone is looking to see which projects LACK Facebook presence as a positive to informing their decision with what cryptocurrency to hold. Even a project without an ""official"" presence should hope to have some community fan pages created on the worlds largest social media platform, or I would expect one to assume the project is very under the radar, dead, or largely unknown. I do intend to visit established communities on FB who I believe would have users interested in Decred to share our page and relevant content our contributors have created. Utilizing the events feature is a great idea, but I would like to see more of that from our local community Decred pages.

Regarding your future plans, the part about ""*auditing stakeholders' privacy when participating in governance*"" sounds especially useful and necessary. Thumbs up for that one. 

I also like the idea of trying to publish to that Nakamoto journal. pi_crumbs is also a success. Does this Proposal include the Journal, or is that separate?

As for the bulletin points:

> profiling the stakeholders' Pi voting decisions to see if there are any interesting clusters that tend to vote the same way on proposals of the same type.

Perhaps unnecessary? I don't see why this kind of profiling of voters and collecting data on their voting habits would be necessary. How can we use this data? How can it help the project?

> the obvious question being whether PoW miners are selling or staking. This has been on my radar for a long time, after recent explorations it seems achievable.

OK, this is interesting. Although not the information we necessarily need, it's interesting. Same question as above: what would be the aim of this research? Would it be to signal bullishness about DCR as a future store-of-value?

>  Collaborating with and/or replicating the work of other researchers who are looking at Decred's on chain data. With @checkmate and @permabullnino now working on this kind of data I'm more interested to engage with it because there could be opportunities to help each other out and improve our outputs, plus sometimes it's more fun to work with other people.

I don't understand this item. Why would you replicate the work they are already doing?  

> Collection and analysis of Decred-related (social) media data is still on the table

Unnecessary, I think. ""Social media analysis"" is not something I want to be funding during times like these. If anything, it should be part of the Marketing Proposal that should be posted soon.  

>requested budget ($25,000) runs out, which would probably be around 6 months.

So $4166/month, give or take? How many contributors worked on this so far? How many contributors do you expect to work on this? Is it most likely just you?

---

This research is interesting stuff but when on Pi, I need to put my stakeholder hat on. I remind myself that this is, after all, a store-of-value.  I tried to orient myself by checking how other projects are funding research and what kind of research.  I took our sister project, Monero as an example. Of course, the important difference is that in Monero and other coins that are based on donation rather than a ""dev tax"", the whales will be the ones funding things, for the most part, but in DCR, every holder does, and this is perhaps burdening the smaller holders the most.   I checked their funding campaign for research of Q1 2020 as an example: https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/sarang-2020-q1.html

The researcher is Dr. Sarang Noether,  a mathematician and cryptographer, asking for $30k for 3 months cca. This is what his research is on:

> Protocol research [...] security models, proofs, and preprints for CLSAG, DLSAG, and Triptych [...] add multisignature support for Triptych and RingCT 3.0 to extend functionality.

>Graph-theoretic analysis. This research is ongoing with colleague Surae Noether, with a lot of new code and math to review relating to blockchain analysis.

It's cryptography research by a mathematician and directly relevant to the CC tech, informing the developers with crucial insights they use to develop software.

Perhaps stripping your proposal down to research topics that are of direct interest to DCR stakeholders, like DCR market/liquidity analysis, would be a good idea. Or research that helps DCR devs. Maybe a dev will chime in to inform me,  I just don't understand why the research in EOS and Algorand is essential. Isn't it just academic? Do you feel that research ever resulted in something actionable, something that directly helped the DCR project?

You also mentioned you were thinking of creating materials to explain LN and to ease people's use of LN, on Matrix, which sounded like a good project to me. Perhaps worth including it?  What other things could help with adoption?

Do we need to fund research on ICO projects or analysis of Pi voters habits etc.? I don't see what we gain by so much active research of Algorand and EOS.  I mean, there's value in that, but does the Treasury really need to fund it? It has to somehow be relevant to the development or facilitating adoption. Your cryptocommons book did receive favorable mentions on Twitter which was nice to see.  At the same time, it seems to be more of your personal project. 

---

You've done good work with the research on the DCR market data, having someone analyze the workings of the market maker was useful. I consider you a hard-working, good asset for the project and I commend you for coming to Pi to ask for funding. I look forward to others doing the same. The whole point of having Pi is to scrutinize. Everyone should go through this 'trial' before getting funded. (Unfortunately, there's lots of stuff that is funded outside of Pi, I think, that the scrutiny of the stakeholders cannot reach. All contractors, especially those not working on code that is crucial to the project, should do the right thing and, like you, come here and ask for funding.)

I'm looking forward to your answers to the above, I think DCR is still an experiment not only in terms of the tech but also, we don't even know yet, what we want to be funding: only things that are directly beneficial to the cryptocurrency or even things that are only tangentially related? So these are conversation we still need to have, I feel. Obviously they will come up more during winters. That cannot be helped.

> I think it is important to keep track of the treasury's funding, i.e. how much went to you and how much to other contributors.

This is all recorded in the CMS, I just don't have access to the figures. I thought about asking other contributors to report their billing to me separately but that would be duplication of effort and I feel it's not my place to push people to disclose this information to me. Also one of the things I like about working on Decred is that this kind of ""management"" friction is minimized, it's not something I want to spend a lot of time on. I'm looking forward to further developments of the CMS which facilitate greater transparency within contributors to a sub-project.

> I think it's important to track these kinds of things, how else do we know what is deemed important i.e. worth spending time on and what's not? I don't see tracking blockcommons with analytics as a compromise of privacy, but maybe I'm wrong.

How would something like view counts help with that? I am generally opposed to focusing on metrics because choosing poor metrics leads to people maximizing the wrong things. I don't write things with the intention to ""drive clicks"", and don't have much desire to move in that direction. I also don't have much experience with running websites, if there is a lightweight option that's not just running everything through google analytics I'm open to exploring it.

> It would be in both you and other stakeholders interest to figure out where to invest time and resources, so making up false numbers wouldn't make any sense in my opinion, neither for you nor us.

That suggestion is not straightforward for me to interpret and apply because ""Decred only"" is an odd constraint to put on most of my research questions or subjects. To consider the subject of ""cryptocurrency adoption"" for example means in my view looking at the space more broadly and what's happening in different projects. 

I also think research which is ""Decred only"" has a different audience to more general research, and it's good for the project to have both types of output.

If it's the crypto-governance-research overviews in particular that people do not see as much value in I could remove that sub-project from the scope. Most of the feedback I have had about that sub-project has been positive, but if people have been quietly not appreciating it then now is the time to speak up.

Great suggestion, thanks. I'm looking forward to getting deeper into that data, and have been pleasantly surprised by what it's possible to pick out with just basic queries. I'm making notes of some questions and old issues/discussions to consult for inspiration but I have found from past experience it's better to just get stuck in and the right questions become obvious as you get deeper.

Given market forces, I wonder if maintaining just your own budget at this stage is appropriate and if contributors show up with legit work, a new or renewed proposal can be submit?

The CMS is progressing in ways which will facilitate better handling of teams or sub-domains. In the previous proposal I identified pain points in working with other contributors on the program, about lack of insight around how much of the proposal's budget is going where. As CMS gets better at handling this kind of scenario, I thought to expand the research program by commissioning other contributors to take on tasks with fixed maximum budgets. I am thinking here specifically in relation to ""Politeia Decision Support"" - where the scale of the data collection or analysis required would often be too small to warrant its own proposal. Whether it happened would depend on what kind of opportunities arise and whether people are keen to take them on.

For the open source research program this seems like a good time to expand the number of contributors, there are more community members with relevant skills and the issues encountered previously are being addressed. I appreciate that some people are taking exception to an expanding budget at a time of low DCR price, which is fair enough. At the same time though I don't think a $5k increase on a project that is expected to run for 6+ months is all that significant, when it would be paying for a greater amount of work as opposed to a higher hourly rate for workers. I'm considering it and will see if there are any more comments on this aspect before deciding whether to edit the proposal.",ca4b7b89f977061f171a266bc129958599dc257517fff71f3d8a57341d01bd0706806577d90ff485af6318ac1812fd6830f194a7910f7e068f5b1ac2ddb1fc02,cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e,13,2b39ab6cfdbbd3836bc5b9d7580103caec6796ef65c4d8f1ef3452ca1422afd9b1588e4d7683d294ef711f7268e098b165a4c7770b47126bfc93705b353ca006,1579112638,2,2.0,False,350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c,richard-red,

**Contractors selling are depressing the price**

There seems to be a lot of focus on this, here and elsewhere. While it's a legitimate concern, it seems a little out of proportion considering the Treasury only gets 10% of the block rewards. PoW miners and PoS stakers get 60% and 30%, respectively, and are probably more likely to be selling to cover costs (esp PoW). $25k spread over 6 months (probably longer considering previous OSS proposals went longer), is probably a drop in the bucket. And that's assuming it's sold not staked (I'm not asking @richard_red to answer that here, that's his business. But many contractors stake most (or all) of their DCR payments). It would be good to have better data on this. Which is why I think a compelling aspect of the proposed research is analyzing where block rewards go. 

**There's ""fluff"" here we don't need**

This is a legitimate concern. However, as a contractor myself for ~1.5 yrs, you should keep in mind that a) most contractors are highly skilled and took a large pay cut to work here for ideological reasons, and b) most contractors already do a ton of work that isn't billable under the current system. Some months I've billed for less than %50 of the hours I worked on Decred. Is that work all billable at 100% of my hourly rate? Probably not. Is it worth $0? No. Like many contractors, @richard_red lives, eats, breathes Decred, and presumably does a lot of work that is never billed. I would view doing some external research into say, Algorland, as a form of compensation for that (in addition to adding to a valuable body of work that is being noticed in the space). 

Full disclosure: I am a contractor that has billed hours against previous OSS research proposal. Though that is maybe 10 hours total in a year, and I have not talked to @richard_red about collaborating on this round.

I think the added request for $5000 is reasonable to accommodate greater participation of stakeholders in research studies where their input may be for a very defined scope of work that may be non-recurring, I don't think it's the best use of time and resources to write new proposals for small bits of work that can fit under this umbrella. 

I think it is important to build upon and sustain work in areas where people have stepped up, shown value, and continue to drive value creation.  While there are areas where greater transparency would be nice, most of the limitations on this data are based on limitations that are being currently worked on on the CMS data entry and reporting capabilities. 

I trust Richard and his judgement, his track record speaks for itself.

Some caveats before I begin - I'm not a dev and I'm just about getting my head around Github but I have a keen interest in the narratives surrounding crypto networks and in scaling open, collaborative and productive digital communities more broadly. 

The ongoing debate around this proposal and Ditto's is one of the most interesting and unique backwaters of the crypto ecosytem. No where else is there such a well evolved and structured chance to surface the complexities and mess of opinions that makes up the collective decision making of a nascent digital network. 

It was RichardRed's Medium articles that first alerted me to the depth of research surrounding Decred. The intelligence and accessibility of the writing was something that encouraged me to look deeper at the project and to ultimately join the community discussion. 

RichardRed shared the Crypto Commons resource with me and asked if I had any feedback. So not only was the project interesting, but there was a way to contribute. This is one of the defining parts of Decred - a collaborative spirit that is very hard to come by in other projects. 

I've seen mention in other comments in response to this post that 'we should focus on what really matters'. 

The truth is, there are very few things that anyone can say for sure, truly matter because it depends on your perspective. 

Price is for most an easy measure of network performance but it is certainly not a good measure of technical competence. However history is littered with projects that were technologically superior but that lost out to those that had a better go to market strategy, surprising use case or that simply hit some particular cultural nerve. 

For me the value of the Decred research and RR's contribution is three fold.  

**The past**
- Crypto Commons and other recent research and analysis tells us where we've come from. It might be an obvious point but without context, there is no red thread to help us understand just where we might be right now or where we could be headed. For many crypto OGs this historical context is well understood, but for me this was the first time I’d really read about the origins of OSS and the values contained therein. More please. 

**The present** 
- This plays more to the on chain research - but wider to encompass a wide range of metrics - both currently measured and those yet to be analysed or tracked. I don't claim to understand much of the more technical analysis but I believe that this area is also somewhere that Decred can differentiate simply by being the most trusted and transparent outfit project out there - constantly questioning orthodox thought and confirmation bias.  

- What are the right metrics to analyse? What are other projects measuring themselves against? Is coin market cap a flawed idea, or does it just not capture the important value created by decentralised networks? What might Decred measure itself against that is a true differentiator and how might that research be communicated? For example the number of contractors? Perhaps 'what should we measure' should be a discussion point or research project in itself?  

**The future** 

- Perhaps this sits better with some of Haon and Amarrooni's writing but certainly RR included a certain amount of educated speculation in Crypto Commons as to where we are headed. Naturally his work is more academic in nature and therefore more empirically focussed, but I would like to see a few more dots being joined when it comes to articulating imaginative use cases for the Decred stack. I believe that is why collaboration between contractors is so important. 

There's a quote I read a while back:

>  trust is the bridge that connects the known to the unknown 

This is I believe why this area of work, bridging the past, present and future is so valuable, because it builds trust and trust is the most powerful thing in the world. Decred’s funded research of independent contractors (and Crypto Commons specifically) isn’t marketing, nor is it something that is a ‘nice to have’ or should it be marked as ‘sponsored’. 

It is an essential, higher order, open source technology product of the emerging Decred stack that helps us understand what was, what is and what might be. 

In the future I would love to see the research products used as source material and inspiration for even more accessible (and even entertaining) set of higher order materials. 

We are seeing this kind of thinking appear in the recent launch of Nakamoto launched by some of the biggest names in crypto. 

> “Nakamoto is a journal of technology, philosophy, and culture”.

Senior contributors write pro bono ""because they want to help build a journal with our values.” whilst less established contributors receive bitcoin, depending on the article and how lengthy and complex it is.

I believe Decred’s existing research team and the evolution of the contractor model offers an opportunity to achieve something that Nakamoto can’t - despite, or perhaps because of the big names involved. 

- Editorial independence
- Collective intelligence
- Sustainable open source funding that enables content to remain free and accessible to all. 

It is easy to chase culture through clicks and impressions. It is very hard to create culture, but that’s for another day.

Fair point regarding the CMS and the figures!

Also, a good point regarding the metrics. I don't necessarily mean that pi should judge based on certain metrics as this I understand this could lead to distorting those, as is the problem in any other organisation. However, I do think it's relevant to keep some sort of tracking of user interaction with articles, blogs etc. to figure out what people are interested in reading about (given the assumption that the mission is to spread the word of Decred to the wider public). Not that you have to disclose those numbers to us per se, or be judged on it. Just so that you can invest your time and resources in the best manner, in the areas that give Decred the most value.

You're definitely welcome to continue contributing to the program if it is extended.

I agree that contractors depressing the price is not a big concern because Treasury spending amounts to a small proportion of newly circulating DCR entering the market, and I also suspect contractors tend to sell less than miners. 

I also ""discount"" the work that's more interesting if I would have been reading or writing about it anyway (like the crypto-governance-research overviews or cryptocommons.cc), or if it involved a lot of learning (like setting up the websites) - so end up billing for less than the total amount of time that went into those.

> the whales will be the ones funding things, for the most part, but in DCR, every holder does, and this is perhaps burdening the smaller holders the most

The dilution that goes into Treasury and the selling pressure from it burdens all holders equally. For simplicity, imagine the supply of 100 DCR where you hold 1 (1%) and I hold 10 (10%). Then imagine 10 DCR is mined and added to the supply, of which 1 DCR goes to Treasury, and our amounts unchanged. Of the new supply of 110 coins you own 0.909% and I own 9.09%. Repeat, and you own 0.833% and I own 8.33%.

I don't share this mindset where whales should pay more and small holders should get stuff for free.

That is 2.4x monthly compared to this proposal, besides I assume the average monthly $4.1K is not constant and scales up or down with the amount of work done. Looks ok to me.

Besides, the argument ""In project P they pay X for A, therefore in Decred we should not pay Y for B"" is not really helpful. If that cryptographer came to Decred with a proposal, and we had to decide the allocation of very limited funds, that would be a fair comparison (""should _we_ spend on A or B?"").

Extra thanks for Politeia Digest and excellent coverge in Decred Journal. I'm sure they gained a lot of value from this research program.

Research is our eyes and ears that collect, and brains that process information. Research informs us about Decred (inner) and the world surrounding it (outer). I said it a [year ago](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c68bb790ba0843980bb9695de4628995e75e0d1f36c992951db49eca7b3b4bcd/comments/32) and I still think so: Sophisticated intelligence can help us make much better decisions. I'd like to see our research community and tech grow further.

I like that this proposal doesn't set strict duration but rather focuses on the total budget cap. To be honest, I would double the research expense cap as soon as we get a few more researchers as committed and reliable as richard-red.

Speaking of content, I like all the items and especially excited for privacy research to see how bad address reuse really is.

There is much more to research. Most of the things I noted do not involve processing and studying the data, but rather investigatory/mapping work:

- [funding models](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/decred-research/wiki/Funding-Models): the Treasury is the grand energy capacitor for long term survival. But it's not the only entity that could power building of great things. In addition to Treasury, which can be viewed as ""state funds"", we could design a crowdfunding system powered by ""private funds"" (although Treasury could participate in it as well). The role of research here would be to survey the space for good ideas or existing implementations.
- [archiving](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/labels/archiving) and knowledge preservation
- mapping software to support building our infra in most pressing places ([calendar](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/116), [file archive](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/26))
- [open hardware](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/28): because wihout secure hardware that we can trust crypto cannot reach its goals of individual sovereignty
- screening services in the Decred ecosystem (wallets, processors, exchanges, merchants) and collecting knowledge in one place
- push contributor tracker [further](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/67de0e901143400ae2f247391c4d5028719ffea8308fbc5854745ad859fb993f/comments/7)

> What are the right metrics to analyse? What are other projects measuring themselves against? Is coin market cap a flawed idea, or does it just not capture the important value created by decentralised networks? What might Decred measure itself against that is a true differentiator and how might that research be communicated? For example the number of contractors? Perhaps 'what should we measure' should be a discussion point or research project in itself? 

These are good questions. It is worthwhile to spend some time figuring out what to measure and how to go about it, because once metrics become part of the decision-making process they will influence voters and contractors. Bad metrics are worse than no metrics, because they lead people to focus on the wrong things. Selecting the right metrics of success is an element of the project's strategy.

> ""bold move to request an increase in funding for non-dev work during these difficult times (winter)!""

Yeah I thought about that but it's not like I'm asking for extra funding to deliver the same thing, it would buy 25% more research time. The idea is to engage more with other contributors, but if that doesn't happen it would just mean the budget lasts longer. I don't plan to increase the amount of time I spend on this as compared to the last 7.5 months.

> Does this Proposal include the Journal, or is that separate?

This doesn't include Journal work, but there does tend to be a good amount of overlap between Relevant External and the crypto-governance-research project. For example if I cover a project on crypto-governance-research that sometimes generates items which I can copy/paste or quickly re-write for the Journal. Also it's not really possible to cover news about a project's governance accurately without getting to know it to at least some degree, which in practice amounts to collecting the kind of answers crypto-governance-research is looking for.

> I don't see why this kind of profiling of voters and collecting data on their voting habits would be necessary. How can we use this data? How can it help the project?

Good questions. I think of the motivation for this as similar to the motivation of the privacy auditing research - whatever can be done easily will probably be done by external parties without transparency, they would have whatever edge it gives them unless there is an open version of the same research. I also think understanding the stakeholders' positions on issues in more detail is good generally as it makes them more of a known quantity which lends itself to greater predictability for the network.

To the question about the purpose of monitoring reward flows I would say the point is just to better understand the activity on the Decred blockchain and how different ecosystem actors are contributing.

> Why would you replicate the work they are already doing? 

Replication is a core aspect of the scientific method, and having two independent researchers produce the same results gives a greater confidence that the results are accurate. I'm not talking about spending much time on this, but if we're working on the same data-sets then easy opportunities to replicate analyses could emerge and would be a bonus.

> So $4166/month, give or take? How many contributors worked on this so far? How many contributors do you expect to work on this? Is it most likely just you?

In the first 2 phases there were I think 4 other people besides me who billed some hours. I don't know exactly what others billed but I believe I accounted for most of the budgets. The first 2 phases have also tended to go a little longer than expected with their budgets (last phase was 7.5 months rather than 6). I don't know how many contributors would work on phase 3 but I hope it's not just me! 
 
>  I just don't understand why the research in EOS and Algorand is essential. Isn't it just academic?

I wouldn't describe it as ""essential"", but I do think it is valuable. In practical terms, for a project to be ""leading"" on governance, I would expect it helps if the people associated with it know about the governance of other projects - for Decred I think that extends to the stakeholders, or at least vocal stakeholders. For me though the real value is indirect, and comes from helping to improve the level of understanding of blockchain governance generally. This is a new and important subject where the ""state of the art"" is still not very advanced and thus relatively easy to improve upon. As a project with high-functioning governance, Decred should also stand to benefit from a better general understanding of the subject.

> I mean, there's value in that, but does the Treasury really need to fund it? It has to somehow be relevant to the development or facilitating adoption

I see where you're coming from but at the same time the [""governance models research"" suggestion](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb/comments/14) was one of the highest scoring comments when I originally sought research ideas, and was firmly part of the proposition when the last proposal was approved. I'm not really considering to drop it unless I get that kind of feedback from more stakeholders this time around.

I don't think having this less directly beneficial research included in the scope really detracts from directly useful research. As noted in the proposal, I tend to switch to whatever task seems most pressing, so it's not really an issue with regard to my own time. The crypto-governance-research project and cryptocommons.cc are quite different in character to the more quantitative stuff, so switching to them for a break every now and then also helps me to avoid burn-out. 

The cost of the program is modest enough that I don't think it is preventing other research proposals from being funded either, so it's not a scenario where choosing to fund this program means not funding another one which offers more directly beneficial research.

If I really had to rank the different aspects of the program in terms of overall benefit to the project over the long-term, I would put cryptocommons.cc and related work near the top, but I'm not sure I can articulate the reasons why or make that case very well at present.

> You also mentioned you were thinking of creating materials to explain LN and to ease people's use of LN, on Matrix, which sounded like a good project to me. Perhaps worth including it? What other things could help with adoption?

I'm still thinking about it, but it's probably not research so much as helping with docs. Maybe when I get into it I'll see more room for research.

Just a footnote to this:

>I think it would make sense if there are some credits given, perhaps a small paragraph at the end about DCR treasury 

Not only for the reason you mention (outsiders get to know the Treasury) but also for disclosure reasons.  Research and everything else that is done from Treasury should contain a ""this has been sponsored by the Treasury"".  ""Funded by DCR Treasury"" doesn't necessarily imply bias, but it's fair to disclose that it's paid content.  If research on cigarette smoking was sponsored by Philip Morris, you'd want to know that.   If the research is objective and based on demonstrable stats, then it wouldn't matter anyway.  Objective truth is objective truth, no matter if sponsored or not.  But when research is in the form of opinion/Medium articles, it's different.

(Even Tweets should contain such message if some contractors are paid to tweet, otherwise, it's hard to distinguish genuine opinions from paid shill posts. Although I understand this is hard due to tweet message limitation.)

That combined with vague descriptions tells me there’s unlikely any original thought and new value being brought to the table. If your plan is to work with Stakey illustrations, it should be only reasonable to first consult with Lustosa, who has authored the character and bulk of the stakey illustrations.

Secondly on the other examples, there’s quite an extreme range of low to higher quality works as well illustration styles. This leads me to believe that you’re unlikely the author of at least some of them. As you’ve not provided any portfolio or proper web presence of your team, I can’t consider the various links as legitimate examples.

- Stickers pack ready for print or web use
-     Stickers pack ready to use in Telegram
-     One-page document with explanation what Decred is
-     Web-site where you can download all this for free

The price is 3x, and while it's true we already know Ditto while we don't know Monde, this is both positive and negative. Negative, because we don't know whether Monde can deliver all those top media articles like CoinDesk. But positive, because there's no history of a PR firm overcharging the project for so many months doing stuff that turned out to be largely irrelevant. It's not their fault, it's our fault for not telling them to reduce it to the essentials earlier. Still, the memory of all that money thrown away is there. 

One good thing about Lindsey vs Ditto is she didn't oversell or write things like ""altcoin winter is almost over, we are confident"" (trying to convince us with hopium). She seems to be very direct and honest and just tell it like it is, which is a huge plus.

Having said that, I'd like to reiterate how we do not need to necessarily pick one of the two.  Since PR didn't help us in the past 12 months, there's no reason for stakeholders to feel FOMO, fear of missing 2020 bull run.

Seeing that Ditto imo. haven't delivered as hoped, I find it hard based on what I've read to believe that one person can. 

Also, a comment like

make me question whether we can believe what you're trying to sell us. Having access to all U.S. journalists is simply not possible, so writing stuff like that doesn't make me comfortable.

**Could your experience/insights be helpful to other Decred's communities where English is not the first language? How?**
If we wanted to expand the PR efforts to different countries I would need to work with a PR professional or team in each market who spoke the language, had access to and could pitch local media contacts.

20,bdd02d82547bd78fc95939c1e2b3df21ebec6e8d31444df5bea3c133b0199f05,1,"Hi Praxis, thank you for the feedback! I agree, it's good to have more than one option to consider. Thank you also for your questions, here are my responses: 

**1)	How do you rate or evaluate DCR's PR in 2019, what did you like or dislike about the work so far, as a DCR stakeholder and as a PR person? **

I think good results were achieved with the crypto press but I would have expected more mainstream pieces with the size of the team and budget. As indicated by my proposal I believe steady media outreach and keeping Decred front of mind with the media can be achieved with a lower budget and smaller team. I monitor the news daily and continuously pitch clients to relevant journalists and stories. I also make sure we’re announcing all key milestones and news-worthy activity. It’s clear the number one result the community wants from PR is quality media coverage so I believe that’s where the focus should be going forwards, as opposed to other work carried out on social media and events. I also think there are additional areas of the media we can target like personal finance outlets. 

**2)	In your view, what would be the damage if DCR doesn't have any PR firm (incl. you or Ditto)? **

Media coverage is often referred to as ‘earned media’ and for good reason. It takes time and effort to secure these articles. A journalist’s job isn’t to find companies to write about and provide free exposure, it’s to communicate relevant stories to their audience. That's why PRs work with companies to extract news, create content and communicate it to the right journalists, at the right time, in the right way. Without this work, there would be less media exposure. PR results also tend to improve over time with continued outreach, so it makes sense to build on the momentum that’s been created, as opposed to stifling it. 

**3)	Does it have to be 1-year commitment? Would you be willing to consider 6 months, like them?**

Media outreach can be a long game and securing stories can take weeks, even months which is why year (sometimes multi-year) contracts tends to be the norm. My understanding was that the community was previously hesitant to commit to a year due to the high cost. 

If the feedback is still that six months would be preferable I would be willing to consider this. I can also add a clause that the community can stop working with me at any point by giving a 30-day notice.

I also think we should shorten the period to 6 months, and if all go well, you can always submit another proposal near the end of 6 months to extend the cooperation further, this will give you better motivation in addition to being a Decred stakeholder.

I appreciate your short and concise proposal, it is very much aligned with what Ditto have proposed in their second revision, focused primarily on media relations. I too would support reduction to 6 months, I think once you have built trust and confidence in delivery with stakeholders, longer terms will see more support.

First some questions and then my general view with regards to Ditto vs Monde.
1) Do you believe that as a single PR operator you will be able to deliver a volume of work in comparison to a team like Ditto? 
2) Do you have similar crypto related clients?
3) Can you please expand on the news outlets and contacts you have direct access to? This is an area Ditto has strengths as they have forged relationships over the past 12 months.
4) What are the key narrative and features that you foresee playing into Decred's strengths in 2020?

Regarding competitive analysis:
Ditto are the incumbents and have experience and momentum with the project. Whilst the team size has been paired back to match the budget requirements of the project, they are still able to draw on the wider team for experience and media contacts. The Fee of $10k for 2x team members plus wider experience strikes me as only a minor premium compared to an individual contractor at $3.5k. Thus, I feel both fees are appropriate as a value for money proposition. Ditto also retain an advantage in that the scale and coverage attained for both Decred and other blockchain projects is a stronger fit than those you have presented. This is not a discredit to your work, more a reflection that stakeholders have a gauge on output and delivery from Ditto whilst Monde is more of an unknown. 

Good luck in the vote and I look forward to your responses.

**1) Do you believe that as a single PR operator you will be able to deliver a volume of work in comparison to a team like Ditto? **
I think this is a good question but it’s a tricky one to answer. I’ve secured 40-50 pieces of coverage for clients in a six month period working solo. I was also achieving more than 200 a month when I was in-house managing a team of four. But it’s all dependent on the company/project and the news cycle which of course is unpredictable. What I can deliver, is a media relations strategy that ensures we’re pitching both proactive and reactive stories regularly to maximize the opportunity of being featured, for a smaller fee. 

**2) Do you have similar crypto related clients?** No  

**3) Can you please expand on the news outlets and contacts you have direct access to?** I have direct access to all U.S. journalists and media outlets, along with journalists in Canada and the UK. 

**4) What are the key narrative and features that you foresee playing into Decred's strengths in 2020?** This is what we’ll discover in the PR prep, where I’ll create a calendar of key project announcements/milestones, pertinent news events, conferences we’re attending etc. so we can map out what the PR outreach will be to ensure there’s a continuous stream and we’re maximizing the chances of getting featured.

We agree with a lot of what you had to say! We too are mindful of the Treasury, which is why we reduced the retainer. In terms of results, we feel like that’s where we have truly shined. I remember there being some grumbling that Trey was tweeting “client!” when Decred got a piece of coverage. He does that for all our clients, and it’s mainly to spread awareness of the client and celebrate exciting moments. No doubt we are proud of only working with top-tier projects like Decred and want to share that! (Besides, tweeting “client!” would be really crappy marketing. :P) 
 
We do understand the contradiction: high awareness, undervalued. That doesn’t seem to jive. But I think we can say without a doubt that we achieved heightened awareness in 2019. From WSJ to CoinDesk to Pomp to Laura Shin — the list goes on — we delivered. We have all been calling Decred “undervalued” since we started working with Decred. Is it undervalued in terms of price? Yes! Is it undervalued in terms of reputation? No. But the good news is, this debate isn’t around Ditto’s inability to execute. It’s more about: Does Decred need PR? This debate has been ongoing since before we started working together. But this type of honest discussion is the sign of a healthy community, and we’ve enjoyed being part of it! 
 
We agree with your thinking around awareness and positive metrics. Here’s a question: Does Decred have data on things like wallets and exchange purchases? We were approached in 2019 by two different institutional companies who wanted to take a position in Decred. Did that happen? We’d love to learn more! 
 
We are happy to have this discussion, but we just don’t think there’s any debate around an increase in awareness. Just the sheer number of stories Decred got in 2019 and coupled with activating the community online is proof. I recall, before Jake’s interview with Ryan Selkis of Messari, Ryan said it seemed like Decred was everywhere. That was a big moment that put all our work into perspective. In the past year, Decred has been featured in one of the top newspapers in the world, top crypto trades, and the two top podcasts. Respectfully, we increased awareness. Now, our job wasn’t to increase Decred’s Twitter or YouTube following. But more people read about Decred than ever before in 2019, and more community members are participating in external communications. This is something we should celebrate! And credit where it’s due: This wouldn’t have been possible without the community’s help. 
 
Again, it was a chilly 2019 for alts, so there’s only so much PR can do during these times. We have wondered internally, not just about Decred, but all crypto projects: What if they hadn’t had PR in 2019? What if there was no news on Decred? And we purposely brought up price because it’s something everyone talks about — but in private. By no means do we claim responsibility for higher or lower price, amount staked, or any other price-related metric. Our intention in the “Recap of DCR and Crypto in 2019: Looking at Price During Alt Season” section was to take a bird’s-eye-view and celebrate Decred’s achievements at a high level in 2019 — everybody needs a morale boost right now! 
 
In terms of “well respected,” we simply meant that we’ve helped Decred and been a partner along the way in 2019 to maintain and grow that respect. 
 
Wikipedia wasn’t our job. And our job wasn’t to grow your social media following. When I mentioned the metric on the podcast, I was referring to impressions — so I’ll humbly admit I mistakenly said “followers” instead of “impressions”! The intention was to share a nugget of data that demonstrates the work we have been doing to activate the community. 
 
Yes, bigger projects that have been around longer get more coverage than Decred, as we noted in the proposal. I think it’s great that we are having this conversation! It’s not about “where’s our coverage?” It’s about “we want to be mentioned with the bigger projects.” That’s a great goal to have! And look, a lot of ETH news came out at Devcon and will continue to come out because of Vitalik and ETH 2.0. And we want to keep fighting for Decred to get you in these stories! We made a lot of progress in 2019, and we want to continue that in 2020. 
 
Ultimately, this comes down to Decred needing to decide if PR is worth it and what you hope to get out of it. In 2019, we wanted to get broad awareness. In 2019, we set out to define what Decred is and have you it own issues like governance. We never set out in 2019 to attach our work to price, and I’m not sure anyone would think PR and price solely correlate. And again, price is a tough conversation to have, but we felt it needed to be discussed — especially for 2020.
 
In terms of grassroots, we are hoping to help ignite that movement and make it organic. Decred approved for us in Phase 2 to create a system where members are engaging and on message online. And we have absolutely succeeded at that! We’d like to keep building up that program, with the hope that we hit a tipping point and there’s no need anymore for us to organize.
 
We are going to respectfully disagree a little on your social media assessment. Personally, we loved the #DecredDanceChallenge! We recall one community member noting that they’d never seen some of the people participating in the challenge. And we think it’s important that when the community engages online they are all pushing the right message and have the best educational materials readily available. Now, that doesn’t mean it’s the ONLY way to do things, and we don’t think this stops anyone from being organic either. But love the Steve Buccemi quote!
 
Yes, we agree. Price has been a taboo subject, and maybe us bringing it up is why we are seeing a lot of passion in these comments. And that’s good! We know there’s frustration. And it’s why we want to not only talk about price, but also what we can do better or differently in 2020 to put Decred in the best place possible for when the market changes.
 
We aren’t technical (and never claimed to be!), but we are optimists. We like to think there are a lot of people in the community who believe that 2019 will set the stage for a strong 2020 and/or 2021. We simply want to be a part of Decred to continue down that path.

But the truth is: Libra was announced, and Jake got a lot of media coverage! One thing we can say with certainty as PR professionals who work in the media field is that for the first time, the entire WORLD paid attention to crypto. And Decred was in those stories! So, yes, more people read about Decred. That’s part of how we work. When big national news breaks in crypto, we insert our clients into the conversation. And sometimes that interview sparks continued interest from the reporter.
 
Funny Linux reference! Listen, we are just trying to be optimistic, as we truly feel like we are part of the community. We aren’t here to sell you any bullshit. If we were, we wouldn’t be as ingrained in the community as we are. Leslie, Margaret, Trey, Anastasia, and I are intellectually challenged, excited, and fulfilled by all the conversations we have in Matrix and the work we do out in the field for Decred. Have we hit the bottom? Hopefully. We don’t know. Will this be a better year for alts? Hopefully. We don’t know. There are lots of positive signs for Decred, building off of 2019. But the purpose of our comments was to convey positivity and even rally the community. We want Decred to be excited about 2020! But we know that price has everyone down. 
 
When I read the phrase “Marketing firms are best at marketing themselves,” I have a couple thoughts. First, we just aren’t a marketing firm. Ditto has done a good job of establishing itself as an anti-PR firm. We focus on executing (as you can see in the recap), we celebrate our wins, and we move on. We don’t have time or the desire to go around and pursue new crypto business when we’re already working with some of the best projects out there — Decred being one of them. 
 
“You sold your soul”: Okay, sure. And you got a lot for it! Just not a price increase. And as others have noted, PR shouldn’t be solely responsible for price. It’s not a silver bullet. 
 
What we’re doing is positioning Decred for the long term. It’s not as tangible as a line of code, but it’s just as important to Decred’s long-term sustainability.

So I'll just comment on how I'm evaluating this proposal and past work + where I would like efforts to go in the future. Please keep it mind that I have the utmost respect for Ditto their team and what they've done for us. They are possibly the first example of an entirely unknown contractor of size, joining the project, having their people integrate our community and become and active and vibrant participant of our ecosystem.

**What I find the most valuable in what was delivered in the past:**

- Media training: Ditto provided media training to many Decred community members and contractors and I feel this brings practical and valuable skills for the project and how we interact with medias in general. However, IMO this new proposal should provide limited media training as most current community members and contractors have already been trained. There is a need for newcomers, and current members deciding to step in the spotlight, but budget for this service should be scaled down accordingly.

- Decred's messaging, positioning, talking points: Before Ditto, this was a mess. Even if most of us who have been here for a while are really confident in the project and feel strongly about what it represents in the CC space, there was no concerted effort to identify how to translate those feelings to those who don't know about Decred. What we have now is a lot more convenient, concise and usable. However, I feel there's a limit to how much we can realistically refine messaging. Sure it will evolve over time, and I do feel a little upkeep is required as well, but if we change and revise these elements constantly, it will make it difficult to appear consistent in what we try to communicate. From this point I feel like budget on this should be kept to a minimum because once we have the basics in place, everything else can only brings in minimal value for at increasing costs.

-Top tier placements: (I'm considering both articles, conferences or interviews). This is what Decred still lack the most imo and what can brings the most value to Decred from a PR perspective. The issue isn't content,  the community already produces an impressive amount of quality literature and possess a collective knowledge that is just amazing. But we need it to be more visible. We need outlets to take notice to the point they come to us for this content. IMO, if we continue with a PR firm,  this should be priority #1, because I feel there is pretty much nothing else that can be done to bring direct value/visibility to the Project for a PR firm right now.


**What I find not valuable in what was delivered in he past:**

- ""Side-effect marketing"" :  For example, quotes from project members in articles unrelated to Decred. This brings 0 direct value to the project and doesn't raise awareness in the public. It does raise awareness of reporters using those quotes in their articles,  but I believe we're paying a high price for this kind of side-effect marketing. If we want to go there, I would prefer if public awareness was the driving force so that that reporters feel they need our viewpoint on these unrelated issues and not the other way around. If we pay and position ourselves for visibility let it be direct visibility. I don't feel we're big enough yet to play the reputation card and expect a return on this ""investment"".

- Social media & trending : We've had a lot of good hits in social medias lately with decent engagement from the community and people from crypto in general, but I don't feel like Ditto is a driving force for these. Their involvement is at best, on par with comments and initiatives from other (unpaid) members of the community, and I don't feel they have demonstrated their capacity to ""manufacture"" more moments like we've had. So I would leave this out of the proposal, and focus on assisting the community and members when we do get these moments. 

To conclude, Ditto won't end the bear market and they can't move price by themselves regardless of what they say. I don't believe they have direct influence in community involvement and grass-root marketing. so I make the effort to not attribute them merit on these issues and not fault them on it either. However price **IS** important both in how much it affect treasury spending and what should be our priorities for the project.

Considering the current situation I will be voting no on this proposal at current figures, but I feel a scaled down version of the proposals with basic upkeep on previous work, and a focus on top-tier visibility is what a PR firm would be most useful to us at this very moment and price.",face1099e5da87afec037473de212e7ab1e2fd5176864801d397bc4577e7ebed83818ca1682eb9b6584948462275755c1a61ef46b247cd0d1c7b7269e5c1e80a,0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9,14,3e8624522936e4682efbd04910dc40d5fc6a1e9b5f6f084a63cbc3ec7af971766da24fe486ee7f5e2aaf3ad563222e89236ab63af63461de09ebfd07d1965d09,1578514110,9,9.0,False,3ffa2992-ace9-4a7d-abce-51872469e765,nnnko56,

First of all because I do not believe in hiring legacy contractors like PR firms for promoting decentralized networks. The main reason I'm active in the cryptocurrency space is because I believe that inefficient legacy organisations should be a thing of the past. The beauty of decentralized networks is that a high school kid with decent meme skills can have more impact than a legacy PR firm billing 17.5k a month. 

Second the results are not there to justify the huge amount of money you guys are asking (over 100k total). What I liked to see is a price or volume spike after a piece of content was published.

Let me start off by saying we believe the results have been pretty extraordinary. Decred has been featured in the WSJ, CoinDesk, Forbes, Laura Shin, Pomp – the list goes on. Decred has been in mainstream outlets ranging from CNBC to Mashable — not a simple feat. And we achieved even more quality media coverage in Phase 2 than before! So, we do believe we are delivering “results.”

We pride ourselves on delivering top tier, impactful media coverage. In fact, it differentiates us from the other PR firms that only get their clients tier two and tier three coverage. We know this because those projects end up hiring us! So, we always have our eye on tier one. But you can’t hit homeruns in every at bat. We think of it this way:

**The “air game”**: We handpick the best, most impactful tier-one media opportunities. Feature tier-one stories don’t happen as frequently, but when we achieve them, these articles generate quality, reliable sources of information meaningful to Decred’s target audiences and long-term reputation.

**The “ground game”**: We agree that our focus should be on the impactful media! But in a bear market, it’s also important to maintain a “ground game” of constant coverage, both in podcasts and crypto media to signal Decred’s not going anywhere at a time when fear is high for the ecosystem. As we mentioned in the proposal, the more targeted trades still have a crypto readership, and it’s important for us to keep that audience engaged. By  simultaneously maintaining an air and ground game, we strategically target the big stuff while maintaining a steady drumbeat of coverage elsewhere. 

To address your comment about us insinuating that our work impacted metrics: As I mentioned in my response to praxis, we want to make it very clear that we do not and will never claim responsibility for DCR price, amount staked, or any other price-related metric. PR work is not “coin pumping”. We wrote the “Recap of DCR and Crypto in 2019: Looking at Price During Alt Season” section for the purpose of taking a step back and noting some of Decred’s achievements in 2019. 
 
And we do understand what you’re saying, but it shouldn’t impact the vote nor us working together. This conversation should be about the metrics we can use in Phase 3. And jz, we’d like to get your input on this. Are we able to look at exchanges? Transactions? Wallets? Like we mentioned above, CoinShares and Pantera contacted Trey to take positions in Decred. Did that happen?
 
As we said above in regards to the market, we are simply being optimistic. We are deep in the crypto universe and aware that price prediction is absurd. So, this was not a technical statement. It was simply us being hopeful for 2020. Here’s the big question: if things do warm up, don’t you want a PR firm to keep Decred at the top of the noise? If prices go up – and this is an honest question – don’t you need someone like Ditto to make sure the media writes about Decred?
 
I hope you know us well enough to know we’re not manipulative. It’s possible you’re misreading the phrase “From Nic Carter to Murad Mahmudov, Decred has sparked the interest of so many people in the crypto community.” We aren’t taking credit. We are giving Decred credit. We say “**Decred** has sparked the interest…” But, to build off of that existing interest, Trey reached out to Murad on his own during Phase 1 and asked him to do media on Decred’s behalf. So, we did have a hand in leveraging well-known smart money Decred holders. But we never said we are the ones who got them interested.

Jz, I’d be curious to know what you think will sway institutions or “smart money?” This is an audience we have targeted in the past and there was no push back from the community. In fact, most of our projects are targeting institutional investors and are using PR to do that. We can only hope the WSJ feature had some impact.

To your point on community engagement: We agree! Decred doesn’t need managers; it needs doers. When we first started working on community engagement, our goal was to empower the community to evangelize on Decred’s behalf and take over in the long term. And the community is more engaged than it has ever been! In this proposal, we’ve reduced and refined our role to focus primarily on identifying relevant topics and supplying messaging. That was intentional. We believe in the self-sustaining ethos behind Decred and want to ultimately engineer ourselves out of this process. We can act as advisors, but it’s up to the community to take the torch and run with it. 

As for “Ditto doing a bunch of stuff”: That’s not an accurate assessment of what we do. We’re not here to just push papers and chatter in Matrix. Execution is what we’re best at, and we think our results speak for themselves. We’re out in front of the media every single day educating, working with reporters on story ideas, and inserting Decred into conversations. And we have to respectfully disagree that this type of work would have happened without Ditto — we are the best in the business at this, and it happened because of us. Decred hired us a year ago because you wanted media coverage. And then you hired us again for the same reason!

Full disclosure, I’m an independent contractor with no real dog in this race; I’ve worked on Ditto-led initiatives here and there (e.g. Twitter campaigns, helping with copy, etc.), but will not be impacted financially by them not renewing (actually could get more money if we shift to funding grassroots initiatives). I’m not friends with any of them. 

To defend Ditto (who I have not spoken to) a little by addressing some criticisms expressed:

**Ditto are marketing themselves in the proposal**

Would you hire a PR firm that didn’t?

**We didn’t get top-tier coverage**

I thought WSJ, CoinDesk, Cointelegraph and other articles were pretty good scores for Decred. jy-p and Akin appearing on Pomp’s podcast, and jz on Unchained, was almost a little surreal for me personally. Those are my favorite podcasts, and finally hearing Decred represented was very legitimizing for me (and others I’m sure).

I also think that Decred is maybe a harder sell than some in the community realize/acknowledge. In the #trading channel, where there tends to be more “real talk”, there's long been a drumbeat of “projected deaded”, “community is dying”, “price going to zero”, and similar comments. It’s gotten increasingly grimmer as the bear market has grinded on. And while there’s a clearly negative bias there, some trolls, etc., I think it does reflect an inconvenient truth that sentiment and excitement around the project has waned in recent months. And not because we weren’t in CoinDesk more. We must be careful not to scapegoat here, lest we lose focus. Comparisons to projects that have thrived in the bear market (Chainlink, Tezos, etc.) are not really applicable, as those projects were hot new projects in trending sectors (oracles, POS smart contracts, DeFi, etc.), usually with well-connected VC investors (fair or not). Other comparable projects are having similar (if not worse) issues. Decred is quality hard money, with proven incentives. I’m not worried about it going anywhere. And I think the market will come around eventually. When it does, top-tier publications will write more about us. I think even if we don’t renew, Ditto has gained us valuable mind share in a good number of reporters. 

**Ditto are transactional**

I think everyone understood from the beginning this was a vendor relationship. That said, some of the Ditto people have invested significantly into the project, intellectually and emotionally. It was encouraging to see cryptoleslie (who I have not spoken to) become a contractor. I think she’s a good fit and could deliver value long-term should she continue. 

As for whether it’s worth $17.5k/mo ($105k should the contract go 6 months (and I think it’s safe to say it will if this passes)), I don’t know. If we want to keep executing on getting articles, build out the messaging more, maybe pivot to more social media, then I’d say keeping Ditto is a no brainer. 

I also think there is something to the argument some are making that we have already (at large expense) acquired the “assets” we were seeking in the relationship; namely reporter mindshare, foundational messaging, and knowledge and best practices around PR/social media that have been absorbed by existing contractors. Perhaps the marginal benefit moving forward is not worth $17.5k/mo. I don’t think Ditto is “rent seeking”, as some have suggested. But it’s possible they will be paid “rent” accidentally, if they receive more value from the contract than they deliver due to diminishing marginal utility. 

There is also the sell pressure. No PR firm with high operating costs can be expected to HODL a volatile crypto. I myself have to sell most of my DCR to pay bills every month (though I HODL as much as I can). I think the fact that Ditto was willing to be paid in DCR, manage that risk and incur additional operating expenses for it (trading, taxes, etc.), is a valuable service and sign of skin-in-the game. But selling $25k/mo in relatively illiquid markets is going to cause downward pressure on the price. Contractors, on the other hand, often HODL and stake a decent percentage of their pay, depending on their financial situation. 

Ditto’s main competition here is Decred contractors IMO. For ~$200-300k/mo, contractors output the same amount of work an SF-based startup does for a million or two (maybe more). This is because contractors are generally ideologically aligned and invested long-term. For taking on lower pay and higher volatility, they get to work on something revolutionary, and also get a different type of security in the form of a longer-term reciprocal commitment from the project (which cannot go broke like a typical company with revenues, due to monetary premium (here it will outshine most other non true cryptocurrencies longterm, hot as they may be now)). There are many highly talented, highly educated people that I’m sure would be willing to create engaging content for Decred. It can also get creative and possibly get higher leverage from Twitter and other social media than traditional articles. But I would be curious to know more about Decred’s plans there. Politeia seems like it’s only being used for big budgets, not rewarding smaller projects. And I wonder how much expertise is “in-house”, and how much would leave with Ditto should they not be rehired. 

In any case, it has been a pleasure working with all the Ditto people. I think they’ve done a good job and will continue to do so should the stakeholders renew. But it’s tough to say whether $17.5k/mo is worth it. Curious to see what the stakeholder hivemind decides.

I have enjoyed working with the Ditto team and I think you have put a good effort in, but the price tag associated with this role is not justified. I believe that messaging and social media presence should be squarely the domain of the stakeholder/contributor community, and that by paying Ditto such a high rate it does encourage people to defer or delegate those aspects to Ditto. In my view it will be better for the project if we can handle these aspects ""internally"". Liz asked me for input ahead of the proposal and these were my suggestions for scaling down the proposal. I know Ditto team members don't consider themselves ""external"", but the price tag and the fact that Decred is ultimately the client of an organization which is motivated by retaining this contract make that perception hard to avoid. Comments which come across as exaggerating Ditto's role in successes do not help.

It has been nice to see more coverage of Decred and podcast appearances over the last year. If you could continue to do whatever you're doing to facilitate that, in the mode of regular Decred contractors (and at equivalent rates of pay), I'd like to see you stick around. $17.5k/month is way too much though, I'd be thinking more like the equivalent of one full-time worker.",67fdf87ae0dc4f940ba54ef472efb81310a94452997ac72167c5a2a7d91955765ac352839e6387157e77b4b4f024240fd99e6811cf8b8a2435766d7be0873200,cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e,19,ca9004294355f5adff6cd4540d40025c14e84ec7a668e2ea5e8b0449868ca815330dbdf47350f64049a35b92aea85db176f48f5007f20315c5cb6d2216858b02,1578539941,8,8.0,False,350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c,richard-red,

We’re at a low point as a market, and we can’t ignore the realities (both good and bad) on the ground. Our intention was to contextualize Decred in a high-level look back over 2019. 
 
And we agree: Evangelists like you constitute one of Decred’s most valuable PR assets! Decred has some of the smartest people in crypto in its corner, and the challenge is to bring others in from the sidelines — including those who might be less articulate but willing to learn and participate. That’s exactly why we spent Phase 2 building and curating an Educational Resources Repository, which is in the process of being published (can’t wait for you to see it!). This repo will reduce barriers to entry for newbies by giving them an accessible single place with the best curated resources to learn about Decred and get involved. In turn, the community will have an easy repository of materials (most of them community-made) to share with newbies. Everything Ditto does for Decred is, like Decred, built to last. We want the community to have what it needs to move the project along.
 
As for Wikipedia, as we told praxis, our job was never to get Decred an article in Wikipedia. And the truth is, many crypto projects are having issues with Wikipedia because a few influential no-coiners have admin power and are intentionally censoring crypto pages. As we recently found out in the media, Lightning Network is experiencing the same problem. This is a broader issue that Ditto or Decred can’t solve alone. What Ditto can do is generate reputable coverage for Decred — which we’ve done! 
 
As for media coverage being low impact, again, it is up to the community to decide whether PR is worth it for them, and what they can realistically hope to get out of it. I think it’s important to mention: There’s no question that the media are the gatekeepers to the majority of the crypto community. If we don’t keep the gatekeepers talking about Decred, most of the cryptoverse won’t know DCR exists, let alone why they should buy it or participate in the project. It’s all about steady, month-over-month awareness.

I want to give you some major kudos: You were the one responsible for bringing Ditto to the negotiating table in Politeia a year ago. You’ve been our main point of contact and our biggest champion. You’ve spent countless hours strategizing with us in Matrix, on the phone, and on Twitter. We’ve seen the good, the bad, and the ugly together. And it’s been a fun ride so far!
 
I think we can all agree that with Ditto, Decred has gained access to tier 1 crypto outlets and mainstream media. That was an important goal, and we’ve continued to meet it, month over month. 
 
We also agree that our work has set up lots of individual contractors to do things they didn’t have the tools to do before: engaging more productively online, educating newbies, and talking about the project in a way that resonates with various target audiences. What individual contractors **aren't** equipped to do also happens to be one of Ditto’s biggest value-adds (it’s why we exist!) and the reason Decred hired us in the first place: our strong professional connections with the media universe, both inside and outside crypto. And this isn’t just about relationships — it’s about knowing how to sniff out a story, pitch a story, to whom, and when, as well as preparing Decred’s spokespersons for media training to set them up for success. The community’s ability to engage online is a whole different animal from working with a journalist on a story. If the media coverage suddenly goes away tomorrow, the community will feel it.

A lot of the comments and questions to this proposal aren’t around our work and whether we accomplished what we said we would do. This is more about price and the purpose of PR. And again, the purpose in 2019 was broad awareness. We want to be more specific with our purpose in 2020, and we also want to come down in price to reflect the market and show our commitment to work with Decred as partners.
 
We can feel the frustration around price, just like we’ve all felt it (mainly privately) for the last year. So, putting that aside, did Ditto do a great job in 2019? Absolutely! Is the timing of our proposal, coupled with us acknowledging market price, bringing up some passionate conversation? You bet!
 
We have strong convictions about what we think Decred needs in 2020, as we outlined in the proposal. But ultimately, it’s up to each community member to decide for themselves whether PR, education, and engagement are priorities. Do we think they are? And do we believe they’ll be imperative to preserving Decred’s seat at the table with the big guys throughout 2020 and into 2021? 100%.

It’s funny how you called out “inefficient legacy organisations” as something to be avoided in truly decentralized projects. We agree! Trey probably knows this better than anyone as someone who worked at massive legacy PR firms before leaving to found an “anti-PR” firm that focuses on results instead of paper-pushing. I can’t think of a single other PR firm (let alone a high school kid!) with both the connections and the capability to do the media outreach we do, **and** has a former crypto journalist and expert on the team. 
 
You are right to call attention to PR price and ultimately ask what Decred needs. This is an important conversation to have! And while we’re just as much fans of Twitter and Reddit memes as you are, getting a consistent stream of serious media visibility, and breaking outside the crypto media to mainstream outlets, is a long game and strategic approach that requires skill, longevity, and a team of professionals.

And thank you for acknowledging the importance of media training and messaging! These were a centerpiece of our Phase 1 and 2 proposals as we geared up the community to speak to the media and evangelize Decred online. Now that the snowball has picked up momentum, we agree that these efforts can be scaled back, and that’s why in Phase 3 we shift our focus to tier-one media and amplification. 
 
And we also agree that the community has written a wealth of quality literature — more so than any other project we’ve worked with! That’s exactly why we created the Educational Resources Repository — a highly curated collection of community materials that’s in the process of being published now. This repo aims to achieve exactly what you said Decred needs: heightened visibility and ease of access for reporters, so that they come to Decred for more. This repo will be the “face” of Decred to newbies looking to get acquainted with the project. And in Phase 3, it’ll be important to maintain and update that repo as new literature comes to the fore. 
 
As for quotes from project members in mainstream media, we addressed this in our response to praxis, too. But you make a good point that public awareness should be the driving force so that reporters come to us, rather than the other way around. This is 100% true, and that’s been the goal from the start! In the past several months, we’ve had reporters from multiple outlets (especially CoinDesk) come to us requesting Decred’s opinion on matters ranging from governance to the purchase of the .org domain. That’s a direct result of our efforts to get Decred in front of journalists, day in and day out, with insightful opinions on news of the day, as well as Decred-centric news. Getting quotes on non-Decred-related stories has never been our central focus, but it’s an important part of the work we do to associate your name with the topics that are relevant to you. 
 
I’m glad you think the community has been more engaged lately! There’s a reason for that. And you aren’t supposed to feel that Ditto is behind it — that’s the whole point. Decred is a decentralized community, and engagement online should look, feel, and **be** organic. Our job was merely to “herd the cats,” provide training and best practices, and then let the community take the torch and run. Based on your comment, I’d say we’ve been successful! 
 
What I takeaway most from your comment is that you see the value of having a media presence for Decred. We're aligned with you on that, and that’s why we’ve both come down in price and narrowed in on media work and some maintenance as our focus for 2020. It’d be our honor to continue this partnership and continue to get Decred in front of the outlets that influence the audiences who need to hear about Decred.

Our Phase 3 proposal was born out of many conversations with community members, both in public channels and in one-on-one chats. We listen to you and appreciate your feedback. One of the biggest takeaways, which you helped us discover, is that Ditto’s most significant perceived value-add is generating impactful media coverage and keeping Decred in front of journalists day over day, month over month. 
 
We set up important infrastructure in Phase 1 and 2 around empowering the community to engage online, building a messaging framework from scratch, and media training 12+ community members. With that solid foundation in place, Ditto plans to step back on social and perform a targeted maintenance role. We agree the community is ready to manage this themselves with all the tools in place. That’s why we scaled back the proposal and reduced the retainer by 30%. 
 
Keep in mind: Ditto provides an entire specialized discipline, and results don’t happen overnight! Our work ranges from constantly communicating with the media, to providing relevant background materials, talking points, and post-interview feedback to any spokesperson talking with the media. It also includes synthesizing all the ideas crowdsourced from the community and translating that into consistent messaging, as well as writing and placing content. This isn’t a service that a single contractor could deliver. Generating 9 pieces of coverage a month requires a team effort — and that’s only a fraction of what we do. If it involves external communication, Ditto touches it — and we’re at it every single day making sure Decred is in the conversations that matter.

A lot happens behind the scenes to make those opportunities happen — they’re often months in the making. So when they finally go live, it’s rewarding to see the community’s excitement.
 
You make an excellent point: When the market eventually does come around, the media will write about Decred even more than it already is. If we take our foot off the gas now, we’ll lose the momentum we’ve gained, and when the news spikes come, we don’t want Decred to be two steps behind. Our work is about skating to where the puck is going, not where it has been.
 
The vendor vs. contractor debate has been brought up a few times. I think the community would agree that the individuals on the Ditto team have integrated deeply into the community. For us, Decred is more than just work — it’s become a hobby and intellectual passion for us, too. As someone who’s worked with multiple crypto projects, for me Decred has become a passion project and the gold standard for what constitutes a truly quality project. For Margaret, Decred was an opportunity to bring extensive PR experience with internet startups and fintech companies to a decentralized project, and help to translate the tech into real-world benefits. For Leslie, it was a reason to even join Ditto in the first place. 
 
Yes, we’re doing a job, but we’re also diligent about holding ourselves accountable for the work we do. We believe in the ethos, and that comes through when we speak with the media. We pioneered the bi-weekly updates (and some have told us we’re more transparent than most contractors).
 
But you make an important point: How do we ensure Ditto isn’t getting more than we’re putting forth?
 
We’d love to do more regular AMAs, similar to the one [Trey and I did mid last year,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8XjAOMX-VM) to hear from the community: Where do you see our biggest value add? What are we doing well? What do you want to see more of? We kind of got away from AMAs in H2 2019, but we found it valuable to understanding what the community wants. If Ditto is generating outstanding results, and in close dialogue with the community about when to pivot and what to double down on, then Decred gets the right priorities carried out (visibility, chiefly!) and Ditto is held accountable. 
 
We’re here to do a job, but we’re also here to be part of a movement we believe in.

Let Me Explain My Earlier Comment Regarding Joseph Goebbels/Edward Bernays

Decred is Fundamentally Stronger than BTC on the issues of Security, Privacy, Fungibility, Governance (inclusion!) & Human Dignity (all, including the latter, Alex Gradstein champions for BTC day in & day out); and Equal to in All other issues of Sound Money.

Each one of the above ""issues"" needs to reduce down to bullet points in Decred's favor, so that the public can repeat back to themselves those points & to their friends & family. Slogans. If that what it takes for it to stick in the heads of the masses, then we need Slogans & Easy to remember/repeat Bullet Points.

Every one of those above issues is what this whole space is about. And we Soundly Beat BTC on those principles (I haven't even included our DEX). We Got them! Provided we can stick that message & hold it in the heads of every BTC bag holder or just as important, new entrants. How do you hold the message in the heads of the masses? Or, for that matter, our thought leaders in the space? Slogans & Easy to remember bullet points. It's not like we can't back it up.

In fact, that's the point. We Beat (Beat) BTC on the principles of sound money! We need to talk about beating BTC daily and stop playing 2nd fiddle. That will cause controversy. That will engage the talking heads, at least. Bait Adam Beck into a condescending attack. Just as long as we're ready to respond with talking points & slogans that we can sling back when he starts calling us another shitcoin. He will & already has & good for him. He knows how to keep his following engaged. A fair fight is always good for awareness. Aside from satellites, we beat BTC & we need to make that Front & Center.

Twitter engagement HAS to grow. That is a no brainer?

1.  A lot of good work has been done but at too high a price and the requested amount for phase 3 while reduced is still is too high relative to the value produced
2.  Paying Ditto at a  higher rate than individual contributors disincentives contractors from independently contributing and free organic Marketing/PR from everyone else
3.  A lack of quantifiable and tangible metrics to point to as measures of success have led to everyone having to fall back to personal subjective measures 
4.  There have been a number of low value areas of focus that fall outside the core scope of work, time that would have been better spent elsewhere or not at all

I think a lot of folks have given very good and exhaustive feedback which does not leave much to add.  In my view I think Ditto would be well served to make substantial revisions of the proposed work and requested remuneration that address the concerns I attempted to summarize above and other points made.  

Here are some additional thoughts based on the comments I read thus far that could be helpful:

1. Individual contractors a paid hourly and generally have to justify hours worked by tasks and outputs.  It's easier to assess value if one has greater level of visibility into the hours spent vis a vis outputs.  A blanket monthly budget with little visibility into the hours and effort put into it leave people to make assumptions on  value based on subjective measures  that are often incomplete.  A number of comments from others alluded to this by being open to considering members of the Ditto team as individual contributors.  My only conclusion is that there are aspects of the contractor model in place that would serve Ditto in possibly emulating more closely that may address some of these issues.

2. Scale down the operation and focus on only the areas a number of comments have highlighted are of high value > reduce the budget 

I've enjoyed working with the Ditto team and I think most comments here have been supportive of the value created, but I agree with many that there is a big enough gap between the perceived value created and the financial outlay the network has and it being requested to continue funding.

I'm sure the whole room is aware that Ditto has been operating within a bear market condition and price response is driven by far more than marketing or technology alone. Where I refer to price above, I generally refer to Ditto's fee (exception is price and transaction flow as ultimate measure of investor activity). Regarding Wikipedia, I appreciate this was not a mandate, however my comment comes from a position where a 300k spend would ideally have yielded coverage that meets even their archaic standards of two top tier, in house written coverage.

Given the sentiment in the room is primarily centered around the draw on the treasury, I would be interested to hear what a smaller scale operation from Ditto may look like. Perhaps there is scope and interest for a smaller cohort of the team to maintain market presence just at a reduced draw on the treasury.  

Whilst out of scope of this proposal, perhaps there remains opportunity for the individuals, who are now familiar and well versed with the project, seeking side-gig individual contractor roles. Based on the feedback in the room, I don't believe it necessarily should be a case of farewell if this proposal does not pass, perhaps it just requires a re-arrangement of the cost vs output relationship to suit a budget conscious open source and distributed protocol.",ec64f03d356c1e973ecd33a8198c336a609ae278171ec16bb9734843547fc1db99ce801e6f69135cad631d8cd7db236e91f1a1872d0c065d8b5074796cd4750b,ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323,30,f16737cdde146166e6119f7bb745a3d6ff3346e0dc56fe6c608bf4fcf1a27210273d12ffa81b44806001afe7292f81d3f35d35b822b4c0eed25c3736ba229405,1578661374,2,3.0,False,eb486ed6-bbb3-4815-9547-599cc0f28325,_checkmate_,1.0

I understand that a single full time contractor would not be able to do everything Ditto currently does, but I think it's about the right ""amount"" of professional PR for the project, if it is focused on the aspects which we need professional PR for (encouraging journalists and podcast producers to cover Decred).

> It also includes synthesizing all the ideas crowdsourced from the community and translating that into consistent messaging, as well as writing and placing content.

My point is that by paying Ditto $25k it's hard to stop ""synthesizing"" becoming ""controlling"". Long term we need better ways to handle this without centralizing decision-making, so it doesn't make sense to pay so much to have it managed by an external party now. Plus if the messaging is still solid then there isn't much work to be done on that front for now anyway. I was never keen on the idea that a PR firm would write content on behalf of the project, that's another aspect I would rather see taken on by the contributor community.",70ed218f3aed7b1609b65554fa82668a7fbaeef816bc11d859da895f0f2ba4d49437446753a1bbed228c1f643f82fc1ca0b8e3ccbdfa85d7c557f1b2e1361906,cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e,31,4d0f8e154c44a286b2a52b849f3d9d9e3063a134f153609dd7a1665ae897c184c6864728d2f48e78cbcf074c9d530e2875b544f6eee5b0863ade18134884ba06,1578670189,1,1.0,False,350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c,richard-red,

However, if it becomes the kindling that starts the real conversation, we're all the better for it, as long as we are prepared.

Being prepared is where Ditto has my confidence. I see us in places we weren't in 2017 or 2018! And frankly, we wouldn't have had those placements without them. It's a snowball & we just got started. When the next Bull Market rolls around, we need professional representation.

My concern is to be able to deliver the message in repeatable memorable soundbites. What differentiates us from BTC is substantial. It's what BTC purports to be & why this revolution started. BTC is failing that campaign. DCR  is meaningfully differentiated. I mean, BTC's governance is a lot like fiat for god sake. Reduce that into a slogan. And then let's have that conversation with Trace Mayer, Adam Back, Andreas, Nick Szabo and the rest of them.

We don’t think the community is difficult. We understand you all have a lot invested, and appreciate your honest feedback. This is one of the features of decentralized governance, and after a year in this together with you, we’re used to it and even enjoy it. Healthy debate is always a good thing — and it’s even bled over into Twitter today! It’s exciting to see journalists and influencers interested in (and impressed with) Politeia, and the community taking this opportunity to educate them.
 
The significant reduction in price is possible for two key reasons: 
 
- **Scope:** We’ve significantly limited the scope of our work. Whereas the original Phase 3 proposal envisioned continued work on messaging, community empowerment/engagement online, content, and work on the educational resources repository, the updated version focuses solely on media relations. Since multiple community members came to the agreement that Ditto’s biggest perceived value add is media, we listened to them and pared back on everything else. 
- **Number of team members**: In the updated “Who” section, we indicated that the team will consist of Margaret and Leslie, who have been working on Decred over the past year. In the original proposal, we envisioned a team of five: Trey, myself, Anastasia, Leslie, and Margaret. In light of the pared-down scope, it makes sense to reduce the size of the team. Decred will still see the same quality and quantity of media results as before — just reduced work on the “other stuff” like social media, messaging, etc. Decred doesn’t need 5 people to do just media relations. Plus, the community seems to agree that keeping a leaner team will align better with Decred’s ethos of decentralizing work. 
 
Bottom line: We’re reducing the price to be commensurate with the scope and team. 
 
We’ll continue to grow and maintain the relationships we’ve developed with tier-one journalists over the past year on Decred’s behalf, including at CoinDesk, The Block, Cointelegraph, Decrypt, Laura Shin, Pomp, Fortune, Forbes, CNBC, etc. These journalists know Margaret and Leslie well, and they come to us regularly for information, commentary, and stories on Decred and the crypto space more broadly. Plus, Leslie and Margaret are both highly knowledgeable about Decred. I can’t think of a better team to keep the pedal down for Decred into 2020!

Your comments about soundbites and slogans are well taken. The foundational messaging we worked on with the community over the past year made great strides towards establishing these soundbites. It'll be up to the community hivemind to continue evolving that messaging to meet the realities of the market and adapt as Decred's target audiences grow, mature, and change. 

In Phase 3, we would continue targeting media a la Laura Shin and Pomp — the tier ones and impactful coverage that significantly drive the needle on awareness. In Phase 2, podcasts played a key role in spreading the word about Decred. This will continue to be the case in Phase 3. In addition to the crypto-focused trade media, where we'll maintain a steady ground game of coverage, we'll also go after the crypto- and non-crypto mainstream media (e.g. Fortune, Wired, etc.). Both the homeruns and the tier-twos have important roles to play in our media relations campaign for Decred.

**PART 1
**---

I like many things about Ditto, they brought liveliness and fresh air and much-needed positivity into the gloomy chatrooms, and they did good & hard work, but when voting with my tickets, I need to determine how to spend Treasury in ways that benefit the DCR (stake)holders. I need to look at results, not at the amount of work performed or what I think about the good people working at Ditto. The only thing that matters, in the end, is results, and after 12 months I think we can begin thinking in terms of results and not just progress. $25k/month paid to Ditto is a significant amount even for DCR's Treasury, and while 17.5k is a nice reduction, it's still very pricey and we need to ask ourselves whether a professional PR firm is (still) worth it. And we all have to be careful about what is promised in this Proposal: like somebody recently quipped on Twitter: *PR/Marketing firms are best at marketing themselves.* 

**Full disclosure: I voted 'yes' for Ditto before, but I'll probably vote 'no' this time, and let me explain why, by way of commenting one some of the Proposal text:
**
> At a high level, awareness and understanding of Decred has never been higher. From social media to events to media relations, Ditto has led communications efforts on behalf of Decred that have established it as one of the most well-respected (and undervalued) projects in crypto. And it makes sense for the most well established PR firm in this space to be working with one of the most reputable projects!

The above statement claims two things that seem to contradict each other, namely that DCR awareness has never been higher (because of Ditto) *AND* that Ditto established DCR as ""one of the most [...] undervalued projects"" (in other words, that DCR continues to be as ""undervalued"" as before, or more: keep in mind ""undervaluation"" is a subjective category). How can it be? How can awareness keep increasing and increasing (according to Ditto), without impacting valuation? How come this awareness had no significant impact on any metric: I don't know, wallet downloads, purchases at an exchange, follow on Twitter, etc.? All these things are either stagnating or down.

 In the world of crypto markets, still dominated by speculation, the awareness that something is undervalued should result in some buying. Speculators always try to predict the 'next big thing', obviously. So it'd be a miracle if awareness was increasing as much as you claim, with 1 year of price falling vs BTC. You must be proposing a new market hypothesis, the inefficient market hypothesis: awareness of undervaluation is increasing while the price keeps falling.

Well, you then say that because of your work, DCR is now ""well-respected"", but I say it was even before, it was always well-respected, that I can remember. Even ""hardcore"" Bitcoiners made positive comments about Decred devs years ago. OK, respect, awareness - these are both a little bit ... nebulous ... very hard to measure - but what about something more tangible that could serve as evidence of this increase in awareness? Sorry, I repeat myself.

I asked this same question on your previous Proposal (phase 2 I think) and I never got a good response: basically, what I get is you say you are feeling that awareness is increasing, but feelings or anecdotal stories are not sufficient, because there are other people who feel differently, and have different anecdotes, **we need something more tangible and quantifiable.** 

Please be aware I'm not saying ""price should have gone up"". I'm only contesting your claim that you have created an all-time high in awareness. If your only claim was that you managed to get us good media, I wouldn't protest. I'd simply agree with that fact. What makes me suspicious is the narrative you construct in the Proposal: ""we boosted awareness to the max, the foundation has been laid, now it's time for the price to follow.""

---

In *Decred in Depth, Ep.11*, apropos this, Liz said (16:04 timestamp, it's on YouTube): *""This is the most common question we get [...] Number 1 the most obvious measure of success is media coverage [...] Another metric we use is: is Decred mentioned in stories about governance? [...] In the last few month, one of the recent Decred Journal said that Decred Twitter's following has doubled, which is a huge testament [...] another metric I wanna mention, when you at events, do people know about Decred?""*

So, you did manage to get us a few good media stories, the WSJ one, the CoinDesk one, and there's another one I cannot recall. That is a thumbs up from me. Yet we still didn't have enough to not be removed from Wikipedia. Not enough quality sources to keep a Wikipedia page. As for the governance thing, ETH is still dominating stories about governance, just as Tezos seem to be dominating the staking and ""upgradeability"" narratives. I know this is hard to change, but you mentioned that as a metric of your success. *""Twitter followers have doubled""* is simply **not true**. You probably meant something else (impressions?) - because across all platforms  nr. of followers has stagnated or even fallen. YouTube videos posted on Decred YouTube for instance, sometimes get 30, 50 views, sometimes 100 to 200, rarely 500. This is very low even for crypto. I know you don't publish these, but if it's true that awareness for Decred has never been higher, how can we explain such low viewership? As for your anecdotes/feelings, I talk to many people (DCR and outside of DCR, ""bitcoiners"" etc.) who tell me they don't feel any significant increase in DCR awareness. This is also the complains from many people in the #Trading channel, that they don't feel awareness increasing. So who is right? Feelings/anecdotes are unreliable.

What metric should we use, then? I say** the only metric that is objective and hardest to game,** is the exchange rate, say, DCR/BTC, why, simply because it's the one that requires skin in the game, something that should be dear to Decred folks. Sure, one can say ""but there's been a bear market"". To that I say: well, in that case, if it's all up to the market anyway, then why do we need to spend Treasury on all this marketing, if it cannot have any effect on anything anyway? If we all admit ""price action is the best marketing"", then is spending a lot on PR/marketing reasonable? Moreover, some obviously knew how to do it well, some projects were doing excellent even throughout 2019, like Chainlink (no idea how they did it, but I hear it's word-of-mouth marketing, grassroots stuff). And again, I know this is not all on Ditto, actually,  I'm becoming skeptical about spending anything on any kind of PR/marketing at all, if it cannot bring any results: more on this later.

(One note regarding ""grassroots/word-of-mouth"": I cannot go into this too much as it's going to be too long already, but one problem with paying so many people to do marketing/PR/tweet is that it stifles grassroots efforts. People think: if someone is already paid to do it, why should I do it? It creates a 'delegation of work' mindset. In coins that don't have professional PR/marketing, the community feels they need to mobilize. - Nevertheless, many good things happened on crypto twitter re:DCR, but wer mostly started by individuals who are not paid by the Treasury - ie. things that would have happened anyway... these are spontaneous, like the ""buy DCR"" quasi-meme that ignited on Twitter... you cannot force these things. When it comes from users, it's cool; when it comes from a PR or marketing employee, it's ""how do you do, fellow kids?"")

On reflection over Ditto's revised proposal and the potential benefits and opportunity costs of PR, **I have revised my position and I will be supporting this proposal and voting YES**. 
My summary and reasoning is below for your consideration.

I have undertaken analyses to better understand the project position for myself and feel it worthwhile sharing for transparency. The data indicates to me that Decred NEEDS increased adoption this cycle. Retaining  a strong media presence, coupled with renewed promotion from within feels like a sound bet towards achieving this goal. Please see my rationale and supporting charts that summarise my insights based on observations on-chain:

1) Decred rate of adoption is poor as indicated by stagnant, horizontal trending [transaction flows](https://github.com/checkmatey/checkonchain/blob/master/misc/politeia/ditto_proposal/tx_cnt.png) and [active addresses](https://github.com/checkmatey/checkonchain/blob/master/misc/politeia/ditto_proposal/act_adr.png).

2) New features like Privacy, LN and DEX increase the project fundamental value and saw a bump in investor attention in August 2019. These features are however lost on the market if the project does not shout very loudly and consistently about it. Ditto has proven to be on the pulse and indeed delivered consistent messaging at key moments in 2019.

3) Once holders are on-board with skin-in-the game, [Decred has excellent HODLer retention and high economic bandwidth](https://github.com/checkmatey/checkonchain/blob/master/misc/politeia/ditto_proposal/econ_dens.png), much higher than BTC did at the same age with more DCR flowing on-chain, even outside tickets.

My conclusion is thus.

- My personal experience and feel for market behaviour has me tending towards expectations of positive market momentum in 2020. It seems a significant opportunity cost to drop PR at the start of a bullish market. This is the time to capitalise on Ditto's experience and work over the past 12 months to keep the momentum going and keep Decred in everyone's ear.

- Decred needs attention and it needs it now, else it risks fading into the background. The project has historically minimised focus on marketing which I believe has been to the projects detriment. Putting our foot on the gas in this early cycle is likely to be the most fruitful. 

- Decred has every reason to shine in 2020 and the narratives I foresee dominating the market play into Decreds strengths (Privacy, LN, DEX, Safe Haven, SoV, Sovereignty and Governance). We must shout very loud and very consistently about this in 2020 and Ditto's revised proposal fills a much needed part of that puzzle.

- Ditto has done great work and has revised the cost/scope to meet a fair budget at the request of stakeholders. The revised fee, in my opinion, is very reasonable for the scope and experience offered and we already have a gauge on output which de-risks the contract.

- Once people enter Decred, they tend not to leave. Let's focus on getting them in the door.

2020 is Decreds time to shine. I wish Ditto the best of luck in the vote and welcome any questions or clarifications on the above.
Cheers, CM.",b7194a4ac55e0aedd8d564f115d4d4e38cc3663e47231bf3468481ee6ffa7ac3fc4587748510c19f81bd6ee510903ea49dc6b3401aa74571cdfa53c4bd82fa0e,ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323,50,1daef82fe087c373182a7538e91f8846b0773f84d3cc63d4abb2ae35a91458d2e5df1fb8a6ebbd9fc73d7e6d5e822d112af84932d6c53f5535da47759155310d,1578856969,8,8.0,False,eb486ed6-bbb3-4815-9547-599cc0f28325,_checkmate_,

Yes, you'll hardly find anyone here who would disagree with that.

>Retaining a strong media presence, coupled with renewed promotion from within **feels like** a sound bet towards achieving this goal. 

But should we make such decisions based on feelings?

Has the 12 months behind us resulted in increased adoption? How noticeable? What does your data tell us about that?

 Wouldn't this be important to look at, to infer a causal link or at least to notice a correlation between media presence and adoption?



>It seems a significant opportunity cost to drop PR at the start of a bullish market. 

Well, it also adds 100k on the sell side, and our volume is already very low when you remove the fake volume (most of it). That's also a cost.

>Decred needs attention and it needs it now, else it risks fading into the background. The project has historically minimised focus on marketing which I believe has been to the projects detriment. Putting our foot on the gas in this early cycle is likely to be the most fruitful.

I believe ""the project has ignored marketing"" is itself marketing. It's a statement many projects make about themselves, in an attempt to market themselves as non-marketing focused, which is appealing.

But Decred is definitely a development-focused project, no doubt about that. Still, ""minimized focus on marketing"" is a questionable statement and depends on who we compare ourselves to.

I'd say Decred has been somewhere in the middle. Not extremely marketing focused, but not ignoring it, either. Millions of dollars have gone into marketing already, in various forms.

Decred was a 100% dev-focused project ignoring all marketing only in the very beginning, in 2016, that already changed in 2017.

> We must shout very loud and very consistently about this in 2020 and Ditto's revised proposal fills a much needed part of that puzzle.

Sure, the question is, do we need a professional PR agency to shout, or can we use our own voices? You previously said that it'd be better to empower those who are inside the project. What made you change your mind about that?

Again, I guess it comes down to the above question: how does coverage in the media affect adoption? How has it affected it in the past 12 months?

>The revised fee, in my opinion, is very reasonable for the scope and experience offered and we already have a gauge on output which de-risks the contract.

Agreed, the revised fee definitely makes the Proposal more acceptable, but I'd invite everyone to take some more time to think about it and not immediately jump to conclusions because of price reduction, or fear and FOMO (""it would be foolish to stop now that the momentum is building up!"").

The fact that we have 2 PR Proposals up doesn't mean we have to pick one of the two. There was a time when DCR didn't have professional PR and the world didn't fall apart.

In short response, yes I absolutely believe that minimal marketing has been a detriment to the project. That said, 12 months ago, much of the tech was still being built, Pi was new, no LN, no privacy, its just another blockchain. Now, Decred is a machine and we must shout about that right now.

I have not seen a sizeable enough movement from internally on the marketing front to convince me we are ready to get out of the PR bootstrapping phase. As I mentioned in my first comment here, I never found Decred in the media or on Socials in my whole time in this market. I found it by accident whilst studying on-chain behaviour. That is the state of things. Talking heads in industry are now watching the outcome of this proposal. That is a significant level up.  We need some form of coordinated and focused marketing and PR in this early bull cycle. I am attempting to do my part in the whole mix but this is what the treasury is for, bootstrapping until we carry the torch ourselves. The more people we see yelling about Decred in the wild and the more transactions we see on the move, the smaller the fee we can justify being spent on PR.",f39ca29244965e3e23b44e7ed8ebc11f5473b912eae623ec1bd5e355111cf11671579f97b1b3f9b75de110b2731b625a437c82823b88d6ec2e5f0ffe8b773f04,ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323,52,853031d815b9c838cc1d8d1154b41cd45d6292dfd442cb8f07de6f7a5093b4cd7805ff70d54399473becf19531773f85a6d3938c57ca1faf6c9b387b0705e208,1578901122,2,2.0,False,eb486ed6-bbb3-4815-9547-599cc0f28325,_checkmate_,

Your statement that “once people enter Decred, they tend not to leave” is a fascinating piece of intel that speaks first and foremost to the quality of the project, and secondarily to the way the community has collectively approached acquainting newbies to Decred. 
 
For the past year, a big piece of Ditto’s work has been educating outsiders (particularly journalists) in ways that are understandable and resonate, so that these outsiders are entering fully informed and for the right reasons. We’ve found that once journalists learn about Decred, they remain engaged with us and tend to either include Decred in their stories (a good example is the [CoinDesk story Leigh Cuen wrote over the weekend](https://www.coindesk.com/is-bitcoin-in-2020-really-like-the-early-internet), in which she extensively quotes Marco) or write features about Decred down the line. The foundational messaging, which focused on concisely communicating Decred’s value proposition and unique differentiators based on the audience, played a significant role in this process of attracting and educating outsiders. Now, as you mentioned, it’s important to maintain the momentum with the media so that the message stays out there and Decred continues to bring new people in the door. 
 
Thanks for your honest feedback throughout this process, as well as for your vote of confidence.

In the original version of the proposal, Ditto had recommended additional work outside of media relations, including continued community empowerment online, work on the educational resources repository, and content. In the community comments that followed, the general consensus was that at this point in the market, the additional work Ditto was proposing should be handled by other community members. In response, we significantly reduced the scope and narrowed our focus to media relations. We strongly believe that media relations shouldn’t be handled on an ad hoc basis. There are a few reasons: 
 
- Media relations are relationship-based. They require day over day, week over week engagement with journalists — and not from a collective group of people, but from individuals who put in the time and resources to develop those relationships. There’s a reason media relations are a full-time job! Over the past year, Ditto has built relationships and trust with dozens of journalists on Decred’s behalf. All of them, from Leigh at CoinDesk to Frank at The Block to Pomp to Jay at Cointelegraph, know to come to Ditto when they need a quote from or want to write a story about Decred. We’re also constantly looking for new outlets and writers who should know about Decred, and are reaching out to introduce the project and discuss story ideas.
- Media relations are more than just shouting about Decred from the rooftops — they’re about supplying the right story ideas and information to journalists at the right time. Ditto closely follows the news. We know exactly which reporters write about which topics. We know to go to Frank with institutional stories. We know Leigh specializes in international use cases and users. We know Tomio of WSJ is interested in VC and governance. At any given moment, Ditto is having dozens of different conversations with dozens of reporters, as well as identifying opportunities to insert Decred into those conversations. 
 
To your point about Decred doing just fine without PR before, we agree the world won’t fall apart if Ditto suddenly disappears. But Ditto’s job has never been to keep Decred treading water — it can float by itself! Our value add has been and continues to be strategically and proactively positioning Decred for the long-term so that when the moment comes, Decred is riding the crest of the wave: It’s in all the right conversations, and it’s on everyone’s lips and in everyone’s ears. As I mentioned in another comment, we’ve got to move where the puck is going rather than where it has been.

And I want to point out that for Ditto, these Politeia proposals aren’t a matter of “Oh shoot, let’s scramble to tell the community what we’ve been working on for the past six months so they’ll hire us back!” Informally, we engage with the community daily, if not hourly, and have been extremely transparent in the work we do. Formally, we provide a bi-weekly written report, which some have said sets a high standard for transparency in contractor work. And it’s reassuring to see agreement that Ditto has executed well on its promises. Now, the community simply needs to decide two things: “Does Decred need PR? And how much is it worth to us?”
 
Whatever the community decides, we sincerely appreciate your support and look forward to continuing the momentum in 2020.

$10k/month is still a lot for media placements without the other services. That sum may be merited by excellent performance but as a base rate it seems high.

I'm glad you mention **price.** One of the problems in DCR I found is that there was a moratorium on price discussion. When I was the main moderator of the subreddit, I was told that price discussions must be removed because they are, quote, ""spam"". Later I managed to convince them DCR leadership to allow 1 price thread at a time. If you check other communities, price is discussed often. Like it or not, it's what's on people's minds, what they want to talk about. It's how they measure a project's success (of course more adoption = higher price in coins with limited supplies!) The fact that DCR tried to make price a taboo topic severely stifled community growth. I understand this was partially due to regulatory concerns, still, we were the only ones suppressing price talk. While I understand it can quickly devolve, we still need to address this elephant in the room. The Treasury, and the contractors' salaries, after all, depend on it.

This is supposed to be a store of value, after all, and not a charity for funding cool projects, art, and interesting ideas. If we constantly lose value vs BTC, it gives potential and current investors less reason to store value in DCR as opposed to BTC. A stakeholder is aware that a lot of value will bleed out via sell pressure coming from contractors, so **we must make sure all the sell pressure we add, does result in a counteracting buy pressure.**

Although unfortunately, you chose to mention only USD price. DCR/USD is only a reflection, a shadow, and not the real thing. If BTC went to 100k, DCR would be at $200 or more automatically, without any ""increase in awareness"". 

But consider that many of the stakeholders entered into DCR via BTC (there was no other way until recently) and that most volume actually happens in that pair (DCR/BTC): very little volume outside that pair. So if we look at that, we lost more than 2x (0.0045 -> 0.0021) since you were hired. Again, I'm totally aware that we're in a bear market and that you were not hired to ""pump us"", but is this depressing performance on the market consistent with the claim that awareness is at an all-time high?  OK, enough about price, let's move on

>Libra

We spent resources on placing our comments on Libra in the media. While the comments Jake made were very insightful, it's not the task of a #36 cryptocurrency to comment on some Facebook project that was only interesting to the US/EU regulators and to competing stablecoins. The claim that this somehow benefitted DCR is questionable. I don't see any direct benefit. There could be, very indirectly, like someone thinking: ""hm, this project lead made a really pertinent and insightful comment, so the project he's working on must be interesting and I should check it out"" - it's not impossible, but it's such a long shot and so indirect, that it makes me wonder whether it was money well spent; especially seeing how by now, nobody talks about Libra anymore and it's a completely forgotten topic already.

>This is the year for Decred!

It's also the year of the Linux desktop, I can feel it.

>The foundation has been laid, awareness is high

Repeating ""awareness is high"" doesn't magically make it so! Where's the evidence? ""X amounts of articles/podcasts/videos"" is not proof of awareness increasing, only engagement and positive action is!

>""**We are confident** the altcoin winter is almost over""

**Is a PR agency giving us technical analysis of the charts?** And with ""confidence"" even? Well, I don't blame you: lacing your Proposal with some *hopium* is a good marketing move!
But what are you basing this claim on? 

---

This is already too long, so to conclude, a **TL;DR version of my opinion**: Ditto has done good, especially when it comes to placing us in some top-level crypto media, but they are not cheap, the price has tanked to almost all-time lows, while some other projects still managed to rise during bear, we didn't. 30% price reduction is nice, and what I really like about your Proposal is that you started to talk about something that was a taboo topic in DCR circles (price): it's something that is on all investors/holders/stakers minds, whether they admit it or not. So articulating this, verbalizing this, is a big plus and shows awareness on your part. Still, I cannot get over the fact that you keep saying how awareness has increased to all-time high yet it's not reflected anywhere (except in feelings and anecdotes). Marketing firms are best at marketing themselves, so I cannot trust your promises or your technical analysis of the markets saying ""alt winter is definitely over"" (lacing Proposal with hopium to increase chances of renewal!), so while I like you guys, I have a hard time believing your promises for the future considering the above. I think from now on, I'll vote only yes for development Proposals. DCR was purely dev focused and no marketing initially, later we pivoted to marketing, even to things like Facebook/Google ads, then a PR agency, then a $300K marketing fund - and we've seen very little to no results in terms of anything measurable, quantifiable, like even a slight increase in metrics (especially in the metric that is hardest to Sybil: price). 

Not long ago in a conversation with another stakeholder, referring to us pivoting to marketing, I jokingly remarked that if we are going to ""sell our soul to the devil"", at least we should get something in return for it!

First of all I want to say that your participation in answering questions and engaging in a healthy discussion for this proposal is amazing, It's truly great to see this level of debate on the future of PR efforts for Decred. Beyond what the stakeholders decide, there is no doubt for me that you are part of Decred's community and that you've proven that you are PR professionals of the highest level. 

Regarding the work that you've done over the past year, I think is has been clear that the Ditto team has become part of the community and that you're aligned with Decred's ethos. It is hard to measure the work of public relations/community organising/marketing/networking/business development (as I feel the same over my own work), nonetheless, there were clear efforts from the team that took the project to mayor publications. I also felt excited about JZ with Laura Shin, Jake and Akin with Pomp and reading about Decred on WSJ, Forbes, Coindesk and other big news outlets.

As a community organiser/marketer/networker/business developer, I also understand how difficult is to translate our work into tangible benefits. It takes time to build relations that will grow into collaborations that will translate into material benefits. Way harder than measuring the effectiveness of code lines, however, someone has to do this job too. It does not matter that Decred has the best technology (I truly believe we have THE BEST tech in the crypto universe) if nobody knows about it. 

I also want to thank you for getting me in contact with members of CriptoNoticias (the biggest Spanish crypto news outlet) and for giving me documentation on social media and communication best practices. 

Wish you all the best with this proposal and regardless of the result I do expect to keep seeing you around Matrix. 

Best!

We totally agree all people are different and fall down the Decred rabbit hole in different ways. That's why it's important for us to be targeting a variety of media read by different audiences: the crypto trades for active traders and enthusiasts, tier-one mainstream crypto for more casual readers, and mainstream non-crypto for those still standing on the sidelines. The more touch points we have, the more likely we are to reach a broad audience of people. 

And media relations aside, it'll also be important for the community to continue with the torch we've passed to them around Twitter engagement and the educational resources repository. These two platforms are critical for educating newbies and for pushing Decred's foundational messaging on a regular basis, outside of traditional media.

They are nice people and I have enjoyed working with each of them, but that's not really what's at issue.  If they were all regular contractors being paid regular contractor rates they would have 100% of my support.  However, since we are once again being asked to allocate extraordinary amounts of money to PR the results in my opinion also need to be extraordinary.  So far we have spent USD 300k from the Decred treasury on Ditto and this proposal seeks authorization for another USD 105k.  These are vast sums of money even if we were not constrained in any way.

I'll offer a few broad critiques here and will expand in additional comments (for brevity) if asked to do so.  Before that, I would like to address a few issues in this proposal that put me off and highlight the difficulty of assigning performance metrics to disciplines such as PR or marketing.

1.  The insinuation that the amount of Decred locked in PoS is relevant as a metric for gauging Ditto's success is rather absurd.  That trend was in place long before Ditto was hired.  While things like staking or even hashrate can definitely be influenced by the market's perception, our status has never got to the point where there are unknown new players that seem to be showing up and moving the needle significantly.
2.  In a similar vein, having our PR firm market to us and make statements like ""Ditto is confident alt winter is close to over"" is equal parts disappointing and scary.  Nobody can forecast this stuff, and trying to blunt the impact of another large spend with a big huff of hopium and the prospect that good times are on the horizon is just straight up manipulative.  Nobody sane expected PR to make ""number go up"", even though I'm sure we'd all be patting ourselves on the back for making great decisions if it would have happened, but price, and more broadly market dynamics should play a roll in how we plan expenditures as that's just prudent.
3.  There is a decent amount of buzz that has been generated around Decred by various new parties, for example; Chris Burniske, Murad Mahmudov, Checkmate, passages like:
""Crypto community and beyond: From Nic Carter to Murad Mahmudov, Decred has sparked the interest of so many people in the crypto community — especially the maxis.  We need to stay in front of these people!""
Make it seem as though Ditto has been the driving force behind those wins.  This is misleading in my view, and the notion that so-called ""smart money"" or institutions will have their investment decisions swayed by shrewd PR is in my opinion unrealistic.

The main value Ditto was supposed to deliver was PR, i.e. greater top tier media exposure.  It's hard to separate the opportunities that would have not come our way had Ditto not been pushing for them versus the stuff that we could have got on our own.  And whilst there has always been a feeling amongst many of us that we are largely ignored, we still did get some top tier media coverage even without professionals backing us.  The big change is that we are now seizing many opportunities that in my view are worthless and only being acted on because we're paying so dearly to have them brought to us.  Credit where credit is due there were some big wins with top tier media, as well as value that was delivered in other areas that I'm often critical of and define as ""scope creep"" e.g. social media work.  While this may have been explicitly authorized by the stakeholders I would implore my peers to consider how this is a slippery slope.  There's no doubt that Ditto is doing a bunch of stuff, however, my rough metric for evaluating the deliverables would be the delta between the quality exposure Ditto brings us versus what we can achieve without them.  Doing random podcasts with minor Twitter celebrities or having pieces published on sites that receive very little traffic is not the stuff we need professionals to capture.

On a similar tangent, the final topic I'd like to broach is that of community engagement.  I don't have a solution here and this is something that will likely resurface in the future.  My read is that having a class of contractors that are paid an extraordinary amount relative to their peers while delivering results that are decent in some domains and only average in others rightly causes alienation among the community.  If we're asking people to go out and engage, whether it be on Twitter or at real events, and they are doing it as volunteers or as individual contractors while a class of ""managers"" begins to emerge that is likely earning an order of magnitude more than everyone else on an hourly basis, it should be no surprise if people begin to capitulate and develop an expectation that; _Ditto's getting paid ten times more than everyone else, so they should do it._

My hope is that this doesn't come off as too negative, as I do want to be as constructive as possible.  While I'm obviously not for continuing on the same path we have been traveling I will continue to do my best to support Decred as well as the community and contractors that make it so special, and are the key to our continued growth and success, regardless of the outcome of any specific vote.",3ed45ccdd109715f55abf9f2aee949a5a4c620fd99b94bd42e003477743971fda1c86ee3b7d7024b6ff0e885f5de0d3e5f32b0d86757124e93aade295442a10e,db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8,7,66bd9d9230586c01a2021228187549ed54b66d6e24739d39d003822ef80feff958332db7695c5566b74e75e98747cd8d7fb0788245fbc2d4b2202a47b1c04e07,1578439398,16,19.0,False,69934791-d575-44fc-9816-e7e58ff53726,jz_bz,3.0

We were equally as excited to see the engagement sparked by the CoinDesk article last weekend! It was certainly interesting to see various projects discussing who ended up being mentioned in the article, with only Decred and a handful of others making the cut. This type of coverage is the result of months of communication with reporters: education, timely responses, interviews, supplying information and statistics, etc. Stories like this don't happen overnight or of their own accord — and the old adage ""out of sight, out of mind"" does apply to media. It's important to keep Decred in front of journalists so they're informed enough to know which conversations it makes sense for Decred to participate in, and intuitively know when to come to us for information. And ultimately, when Decred is part of a story that sparks a heated conversation, that's a good thing for the project's visibility and stature relative to other projects. 

To your point about it taking a year to become comfortable with DCR: Just like integrating into the Decred community, PR is a marathon, not a race! Most people being introduced to Decred for the first time will require several touch points into the project before they feel completely comfortable.

To use one of my favorite metaphors lately, we've got to move to where the puck is going, not to where it has been. That requires taking a long-term view of how Decred needs to proactively communicate to the media today, next month, and 6 months from now. For us to preserve momentum, we've got to be in front of journalists day after day, month after month on two fronts: the topics that matter to Decred (staking, privacy, store of value, governance, Lightning Network, etc.), and Decred news and announcements. And this is what Ditto will be solely focused on in Phase 3.

Legacy PR firms do this (it's part of the reason many of us at Ditto left our other jobs and came to Ditto!). These legacy PR firms nickel and dime their clients, often with few results to show for it. We're focused on results, which means putting in as much time as we need to meet our client’s goals. 

We reduced the price by 60% because we're reducing the scope of our work. A natural byproduct of focusing solely on media relations is that we'll reduce the time we spend on other things (online engagement, educational resources repository, etc.). 

Payment by media placement isn't how Ditto works — or any PR agency, for that matter, unless they're pay to play, which is generally frowned upon in the crypto and PR industries. The reality of earned media is that it takes a lot of time and know-how to persuade reporters to write about you, and it’s highly competitive, especially at the top-tier level. Another thing that would make a pay to play model difficult is that you cannot predict ever-shifting news cycles and editorial demands that change by the week, sometimes the day, or even the hour. We do our best to stay on top of these, but we cannot guarantee placements will happen at a given time (that’s why it’s “earned” media!). It sometimes takes months of back and forth follow-up and relationship-building to secure these stories. If we are monetarily incentivized by high quantity of placements, this would be at the expense of quality and not beneficial to Decred over the long-haul. 

In its current form, this proposal is the lowest retainer we've **ever** offered at Ditto. Any PR professional would tell you it's an extremely competitive rate for the services we're offering. That's especially true because the community already knows what we're capable of: high-quality results, month after month.

While I generally value development more than PR, media, hype, etc. I am certain there needs to be more awareness of Decred.  Far more.  Ditto is in the best position to do this for us.

If you take a big step back from crypto, you will find almost no one outside of the industry who is aware of Decred.  That's no surprise as most people don't know about Litecoin (not that LTC is at all relevant anymore), but when people do take the plunge there needs to be solid and recent coverage of Decred so we show up in their research.  And it **really** must be ongoing.  News gets stale pretty quickly.

Which leads to Wikipedia.   If someone new to cryptocurrencies wants to learn more, you can bet they'll look to Wikipedia for the high level view.  Not only is their no Decred page, we're not even listed on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies where you'll find Potcoin, Titcoin, EOS, Stellar, etc.  Just what does it take to have a Wikipedia page?

Notes:

- Appreciate scaling down. I think the price is right. Perhaps you could scale it back up when things get better, or when new ways to push Decred forward become apparent (see below).
- Extra thanks for how well Ditto is handling criticism/complaints/trolling/non-productive talk.
- From earlier revision: ""activate the community in a way that portrays intelligence, confidence, optimism, and excitement"" - spot on! Leave the drama, maximalism, price salt and attacks on other projects aside. Staying focused and confident is the only way to build our decentralized future. `while (not success()) do: work()` - that's all we need to know.

Things to consider for peer voters:

- Foundational messaging and other documents built by Ditto are collected [here](https://github.com/decredcommunity/pr).
- Ditto people have been absorbing the culture of Decred community for over a year now. This is a valuable and scarce resource.
- Ditto is one of the [best reporting](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/pr-ditto/index.md#reports) contractors.

Questions to Ditto:

1. Is it in your power to bring Decred to influential+aligned YouTubers? (more generally, independent content creators)
1. Can you comment on PR outside the U.S., do you have any plans?
1. Can you help us fix wrong info on coinmarketcap, coingecko, etc?
1. Can you get us any view stats on Decred pieces placed in the news outlets? What I'm looking for is how much people read/click Decred compared to others. Obviously there's no way to verify these numbers but still it could be a useful signal.

And the big one. I talked a lot about marketing in [this article](https://xaur.github.io/writings/posts/20191127-marketing-strategies.html), but if I were to pick a single item it would be ""Make a bunch of small but highly aligned communities [aware](https://xaur.github.io/writings/posts/20191127-marketing-strategies.html#reach-people-to-whom-it-really-matters) of Decred as a store of value and transfer of value tool"". I'd love to see highly relevant groups added to our target audiences (and messaging) and help them start using Decred today where volatility and confirmation times can be tolerated, namely tipping and crowdfunding. To be honest, I became less passionate about The Media, the ""analysts"", the speculators and even ""institutions"" to catch up, and more about communities that can appreciate or even use DCR today to build great things. I want Decred to be known as the ""building fuel"". I don't want people to just ""buy DCR"", I want them to understand that they can also accept DCR for their work and reward other builders/creators for their work, building a real economic network. I realize this is an unusual request for a PR company, but I wonder if there is anything Ditto could do in that regard?",73b1b082400c6c6c07ccd46ec7371c1387b12f4764db5f26bc803f7ca490ce0406a1609aba17a1f779b0e2a025ae58d19a9c4da9b484a552457f42902e3b150f,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,81,d3ccd5811ed94137c4db8a94da9e83292a8662f8b257c731db21b934c43b4102c1cc7fa4af696ea5dc73e50885057cf3e49c745628cc8022817f67e0e8461604,1579320099,3,3.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

I can't imagine how it can be true. Even if it were true, if one's top reason to give up on Decred is taboo on (low quality) price talk, I don't see how onboarding such people helps to reach project's goals.

> a lot of value will bleed out via sell pressure coming from contractors

Historically, the Treasury address has sent ~30% of DCR it received, which is ~3% of total issuance. And part of that is not sold but held/staked. I guess the selling pressure from contractors is dwarfed by PoW miners who get 60% of issuance. Still, I agree that we should evaluate this extra selling pressure against the benefits.",93553abba007b5b46a41b865a4de87eaea0caceeac658549cc6f34bdd0a7882ef8c45616b432840880b529ebb4e912d257609e6e08664b2b53218d0de135f708,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,88,3aa57048fcf78efabcbe3fe4833c1fab18f8480147a394c5f5df5307c13862c98f0f3b2b3632233e9f405f73f8127345be58c28174561164b8e5a69def469a0d,1579321040,1,1.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

It would be healthy to invite other PR firms and creative individuals to enable a broader scope of ideas to be pitched to the community. PR in the traditional sense does not and has not yielded the returns the community is expecting, especially with the amount of DCR paid.

The reduced fee and commitment to the project is commendable and is appreciated, open source projects require labor of love from all involved. I know that Ditto's work has been professional and it has been a pleasure to work with the team.

I had planned  a longer response however comments from JZ and Praxis have essentially summarised my core position. I agree that Ditto posturing with the success of variety of metrics that, quite frankly, are unlikely to be attributable  to PR is not appropriate. The reality is that on-chain metrics like transaction flows indicate only a minor increase in  investor activity over the past 6 months and I am not convinced it is a result of Decred coverage in Forbes. Personally, I see media coverage in such publications as an extremely low impact outcome, especially when contextualized by the price paid to achieve it. Podcast exposure is more effective however, again, the price does not reflect the reward. Decred should have enough justification for a permanent Wikipedia page, for the total sum paid, this is a serious miss.

I was asked by Ditto what attracted me to the project and it was the fundamentals of the blockchain design itself, rather than any marketing headline. I can't speak for others, but in my time in this market, I have never felt the desire to click on a CoinDesk/Forbes headline. The headline is usually enough and the story is quickly forgotten. My experience with the project is that new conversations and public interest has grown primarily out of people evangelizing the project driven by research and understanding Decred's differentiators (often a technical topic). I have not seen Ditto exploring how to disseminate this high impact information, nor is it reflected in the discussion on 'success metrics'. Price and transactions are the indicators of growth, and for the sum paid, the last 6 months has not been fruitful for either of these.

I do want to highlight that contractors/community who understand the ins and outs of this project are the best positioned evangelists. I would rather see resources diverted to empowering and tooling up stronger messaging coming from those camps.

I very much appreciate the work put in by Ditto and commend their professionalism. However, I believe the value for DCR is a poor ROI based on the markets response over last 6 months, and what I deem to be low impact outcomes (publications etc).

Address reuse (Privacy and Security): In this case, also applying for other cryptocurrencies that you use. While a lot of projects design products using this feature, reusing addresses leads to serious privacy issues. In my vision, every cryptoproject needs to think and address it at the start.

User privacy: in order to generate a new address for every invoice, you probably need users masterpubkey, which means you can track every payment that the the user creates or receives with an address from this masterpubkey, including invoices made outside your app.

The Decred wallets don't have a URI to use payment invoices with amount and description. Therefore your users will need to use another decred wallet that accept your app invoice. At this point, we can't reach all decred users.

Payments can't be considered secured before at least a few blocks are be mined (which takes an order of a few minutes).

DcrData will remain forever, but using only this API, your service is being centralized, and if inactive, your application will be too.

TL;DR
I like the idea about DCR POS, but I think in this case Lightning Network works better from the users perspective. Maybe you can do in on-chain transactions, but you need a lot of work designing this system, think about security, privacy and use the best practices of crypto projects.

- I am not referring to custodial services. Merchants using your service will be dependent on a third party block explorer which is completely outside of their, and your, control.
- Great to hear you will derive receiving addresses in the future.
- *""clients scan the QR code and send the amount by using any DCR wallet""* - which wallets provide this functionality at the moment? I don't believe decrediton, dcrandroid or dcrios can do this.
- Payments are not confirmed within 45 seconds. They may be observed in the mempool, but they are not **confirmed** until they are mined into a block, and another block or two is built on top of it. Mempool transactions may expire, or the same decred could be spent in another transaction which is mined first.

After reading your responses to some of the other questions about confirmation times for payments (got to be straight with users about the need to wait for confirmations to have any confidence the transaction is final), the lack of QR code reading functionality in Decred's mobile apps, and the mechanism for using multiple receive addresses in the plusbit app - I see plusbit now as more of a novelty and probably not something to be used for any significant amount of business in its current form.

Having said that, I do think it has some utility, and $650 still seems reasonable to me for a DCR version and for including DCR in the future iterations of the app.",208a1f0ee318ec571e2e1183f72f23548959794e7fceb6dd0a76c5be4de7d9665907f777fb9a0ad6c2059c55fb8186d4dd944fbbd120b694c1741e36951d4c05,cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e,14,59ff12d9daf1d72f742264cc33b1025c0065c79cca5c7b702daec8b365b23a085733e07bcf21cb397da4e1eea4d14793362174b44e634f7eabdf1c10860d8a0f,1575475293,0,1.0,False,350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c,richard-red,1.0

- The merchant will be dependant on a third party for verifying its purchases - they will not be verifiying themselves. The third party, or the application itself, could be trivially compromised and feed the merchant false information.
- The merchant will either need to insert a new DCR address for every transaction (incredibly inconvenient) or they will need to use a single address (really, **really** awful for privacy, particularly for a merchant using a necessarily public address). 
- The merchant will expect every customer to have a Decred wallet on their phone which is capable of interpreting a QR encoded invoice. AFAIK this software does not exist.
- The system described uses on-chain payments. That means the merchant needs to wait for **at least** two blocks to be mined (~5-10 minutes) before they can have some level of confidence that the transaction is permanent.

I liked the original TD proposal because adding a Python library when there is none was a very good idea and a good buy for the Treasury.

My main concern with this proposal is how much the Treasury should invest in TD before getting tangible returns like new integrations, new software built on top, increased productivity of Research, new developers onboarded from Python lands, etc. Is any such info available?

One aspect of the ""investment"" concern is time pulled away from other tasks like dcrdex or dcrdata. Hour estimate numbers look fair, but how important are those milestones right now, compared to other tasks in the wider Decred project?

I think I understood the motivation of the original TD proposal: facilitate integration of Decred in more wallets/websites/apps + expose Decred to Python devs. But what motivates the expansion of the original proposal with work outlined in this proposal? Is the main goal the same (to boost integrations) or is it switching to build a full alternative wallet?

Notes:

- ""dcrstakepool just added accountless ticket service too"": If you refer to PRs [514](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/514) and [515](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/515) they are not merged yet.
- ""Medium tutorial"": I suggest posting it on GitHub as well. I don't trust Medium for not censoring crypto content. Plus you could get some contributions.

Questions/milestones:

- ""Full node interoperability"": can you expand this just a little bit please, why 120 hours? Can RPC client be genrated from protobuf definitions or something like that?
- ""Python SPV node"": can you estimate disk size usage for TD wallet in SPV mode? Context: dcrwallet disk footprint went from ~60 to ~350 MB with the support of block filters. I'd like it to use much less space and I was told it can be greatly optimized.
- ""BTC wallet"": will it act as a client of a Bitcoin Core node, Electrum server or (ideally) using compact filters (BIP-157/158)?
- By ""Decred DEX"" do you mean adding a GUI for [atomicswap](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap) or integrating with the higher level [dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex)?

Questions/general:

- Can you please give an overview of how TD fits into existing Decred software ecosystem, specifically what parts does it intend to reuse and what parts to reimplement?
  - To what degree TD is building its own code vs reusing dcrd/dcrwallet via RPCs?
  - Is it implementing a wallet in Python without using dcrwallet at all? If yes, what is the motivation do so and not just orchestrate dcrwallet like Decrediton does?
  - Can [dcrlibwallet](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrlibwallet) or [godcr](https://github.com/raedahgroup/godcr) be reused in some way?
- Wallet software protects my money and has higher requirements. What's your plan to make it reliable and something that people can trust? (like extensive test coverage, fuzzing, involving peer experts for an audit)
- Has the time come to split the GUI into its own repo? ;)
- These hour estimates, do they include ""backend"" work or also building the UIs in Qt?",d7799ce889728adef0201d5ca890ba3497a2b60674d924da733f296426eac48f4ca29540f32d71356e5761f25bce1d49af998adec84856811af72abb198ea30d,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,1,f8d2253a4ba37f23b5a791182fd2068e4e8f8ce2aeb71b41a7a70eb6e5605ad9292957e854a203348f0695904ac201dcef94aabd1809c144288d48bbc6a1cb02,1573833295,5,5.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

The intention seems to be to allow the use of the DEX. The DEX client is used for communication and control between the different coin daemons. So if a coin wants to be listed it has to be implemented in the DEX client. Comparable from the functionality with the current AtomicSwap tools. It cannot be the task of the Decred Developers to be a LightWeight Client for other blockchain projects. So if dozens, maybe hundreds of different coins are listed in the Dex in the future this will lead to an overhead and a double implementation in the Python Wallet and Dex Client. In my opinion, the multi-asset support should be avoided and the focus should be on working seamlessly with the Dex Client. The maintenance of the different coin daemons should remain with the respective teams, as well as the implementation in the Dex client (see also here AtomicSwap-Tools).

That is nearly the opposite of the DEX's model. The DEX client being developed in dcrdex provides only one implementation, and while we are striving to keep the parts reusable, it is part of the minimum viable product and not intended to be ""the client"". Any client that can satisfy the DEX API as outlined in the DEX specification can perform trades, and we'll want to encourage all wallet developers to add DEX support to their products.

And to add DEX support does not mean you must support all of the assets that the DEX does. In fact, dcrdex itself does not officially specify which assets are supported. It is up to the DEX operator to choose, and support for plugin-style backends is intended as described in the spec. A client must support the assets involved in the orders it places, nothing more. 

As far as why it's important to do multi-support and DEX in TinyDecred... DEX is going to be an important part of the Decred ecosystem, and we want to encourage its use everywhere.

So could every other coin go this route for fast implementation in their gui wallets. The task i see reasonable is to integrate the DEX frontend into the gui wallet. 

Maybe it is nice to have a second implementation of the DEX client/middleware in python but there is still the problem with the idea to become multi-coin wallet which means consensus validation in stripped down lightweight mode for various different coins. Introducing their SPV flaws (lack of fraud proofs, nodes will be operated by dex orderbook operators), overhead in maintenance (you will need to keep up with every change of the other coins to be sync with upstream), costs for decredproject treasury and developer time and these integrated project could stall and die.

It could be argued that becoming a validating lightweight wallet for multiple coins could attract new developers or going down that path would make the python wallet the goto tool for dex endusers. If so, i still would prefer to seperate these concepts and having a proper gui instead of this beeing done in python with qt.

I am not in support for becoming a secure multi-coin lightweight wallet for other coins. The workload you have mentioned for this will be far off because of future maintenance cost and decredproject most likely will be in need to run these fullnodes.

> My main concern with this proposal is how much the Treasury should invest in TD before getting tangible returns like new integrations, new software built on top, increased productivity of Research, new developers onboarded from Python lands, etc. Is any such info available?

The roots of TD are in 
[my work on cost of attack estimation](https://github.com/buck54321/dcr-research/blob/master/paper/Attack-cost%20estimation.pdf),
and Checkmate has used TD in his research ([example](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1194743086854889472)). The proposed programming tutorial will be my first significant attempt at getting TD out there for people to see. 

As far as developers, no new developers onboarded yet, though that remains a primary goal. There is some interest from inside devs, and JoeGruffs has recently thrown his hat in the ring with a series of PRs, reviews, and new issues over the last couple of weeks. I'll add a personal note and say that TD helps increases my productivity. I always have a Python interpreter running with some TD modules loaded while I'm working on dcrdex. It's especially handy for generating test data, e.g. random private keys, pubkey scripts, addresses, etc. I hope that as other Python-savvy devs dip their toes into TD, they will find similar benefits to their workflow.

I think the TD toolkit has potential in the areas of 1) product sandboxing, and 2) open-source hardware applications (arduino, raspberry pi). One application I'm dying to sandbox is a Decred+LN point-of-sale (POS) system with automatic asset conversion capabilities via Decred DEX. But I'm getting way ahead of myself. My point is that as TD implements new features, infinitely more applications become available. I'll always be looking for a gap to fill.


> One aspect of the ""investment"" concern is time pulled away from other tasks like dcrdex or dcrdata.

I don't see a lot of value in framing it this way. I get what you're saying, but it would be hard to convince me that having more active projects for our devs to work on is a bad thing right now. I experience tangible benefits to my sum productivity contributing to TinyDecred too. I often hack on TD to wind down after working on DEX. Being singularly focused on a project causes burnout for me.

Just to add some perspective to the numbers, I estimate that a single, experienced, full-time developer dedicating 1/4 to 1/3 of their time on TD would exhaust the budget in about a year and accomplish more than half of the objective list. Hopefully I can get some help developing TD, but even if it's just me, I could probably do that with virtually no detriment to the other projects I work on. 


> what motivates the expansion of the original proposal with work outlined in this proposal? Is the main goal the same (to boost integrations) or is it switching to build a full alternative wallet?

Decred has a great set of features. As a vested Decred developer, I have a strong motivation to get those features exposed to the widest possible audience. A full alternative wallet is definitely a goal, but the tools developed along the way will be more important, IMO.


> If you refer to PRs 514 and 515 they are not merged yet

My mistake. I'll update the language.


> I suggest posting it on GitHub as well

Good point. I was thinking of putting the funder and player scripts on github, but I might as well do the entire thing there and just translate it to Medium. 


> ""Full node interoperability"": can you expand this just a little bit please, why 120 hours? Can RPC client be generated from protobuf definitions or something like that?

TD is not using dcrwallet (more explanation below), so using gRPC is off the table. I would break the time down into three large subtasks.

- RPC client - 10 - 20 hours: a Python `dcrd/rpcclient.Client`
- Wallet syncing - 60 - 80 hours: compact filters, database integration, sychronization routines
- dcrd control + UI - 10 - 20 hours: start and stop dcrd from the TD interface



> ""Python SPV node"": can you estimate disk size usage for TD wallet in SPV mode?

I'll be using binary data types for storage of the headers and filters, so my disk usage should be on the order of dcrwallet's. I'll have to chat with jrick about possible optimizations. If there are some that are worth the effort, I'll try to get them implemented in both projects.


> ""BTC wallet"": will it act as a client of a Bitcoin Core node, Electrum server or (ideally) using compact filters (BIP-157/158)?

Ideally, TD will move away from third-party services altogether. The ""full-node interoperability"" objective, if done first, would lay the groundwork for using compact filters for BTC too, so I would cautiously say that TD will not have a BTC light wallet. 

BTC full node is out of the question for TD.


> By ""Decred DEX"" do you mean adding a GUI for atomicswap or integrating with the higher level dcrdex?

Full integration. I'm writing the wallet software for the DEX and bringing that experience over to TD and anywhere else it's needed.


> To what degree TD is building its own code vs reusing dcrd/dcrwallet via RPCs? Is it implementing a wallet in Python without using dcrwallet at all? If yes, what is the motivation do so and not just orchestrate dcrwallet like Decrediton does?

While it's not my intention to rewrite dcrwallet in Python, TD's development is necessarily going to mirror dcrwallet's in some significant ways, mostly because they aim to support the same features. I consider both TD and dcrwallet to be consumers of the base Decred protocol implemented by dcrd. Most importantly for me, TD must avoid a situation where updates to dcrwallet (or any other third-party software) are required to gain access to Decred's features. For these reasons and others, I prefer not to try to build a solution dependent on dcrwallet. I do, however, benefit greatly from dcrwallet's existence. Coding TD is super fast when I can translate things from Go. 


> Wallet software protects my money and has higher requirements. What's your plan to make it reliable and something that people can trust? (like extensive test coverage, fuzzing, involving peer experts for an audit)

As you suggest, extensive testing and auditing will be needed before any official release. I'll need to convince myself and others that the code is sound. I like the idea of a third-party auditor, too. That might be on the objective list next time. 


> Has the time come to split the GUI into its own repo?

I don't know that there will ever be a separate repo, but I'm planning on separate PyPI packages for the toolkit and the wallet when the time comes. I'm starting to reorganize the repo to accommodate that plan.


> These hour estimates, do they include ""backend"" work or also building the UIs in Qt?

Estimates include at least a rudimentary GUI interface. The reason I say rudimentary is because I am not prioritizing any major design work yet, though some work in that area is certainly warranted. Any UI improvements right now will fall under **general maintenance** until I can formulate a comprehensive UI/UX gameplan, at which time funding will be requested explicitly. TinyDecred is in it for the long haul, though. Everything in due time.

Just for perspective, I once created a Windows installer for a PyQt app that carried its own portable Python (stripped down WinPython), and the installer was about 40 MB. Part of preparation involved carefully culling the PyQt libraries that weren't being used.

There seems to be a lot of opinion and very little agreement regarding GUI toolkits. I'm not opposed to using something different, but Qt just works and I haven't heard a good argument for another.",c023a1a2dd0ad04a2dda17a0de22cbe289fda31eee1771c1d48540b9dbc35b37044f9cef77cd09f1d932ce0e8bb57d0af7dcf4cebb90935c1c2dfefd0e3e9b0a,7e0d27a299b37423a7951e30361c178fdd6cbdc731b62a6c33c1185aabd5e60a,9,2ff5f433723a0bb5e801d30495719eb6196ed9d02655fc1a8fd50dd84e0623c681cb18c21c5985d0af3e41f101e08c77e277a3677d3c54c27b5a1eff1fe0ec06,1574038061,3,3.0,False,4bfa47b8-b43c-4c7d-a385-5e1787829624,buck54321,

Notes:

- Glad to see ""Adoption of DCR as Medium of Exchange"" included, IMO it's underrated. I know it's too early for DCR to function as a full MoE, but we can already send DCR to each other _today_ to thank for good work. People sending money to each other directly is an important habit required to build that peer-to-peer _economy_ that peer-to-peer _currencies_ were made for. I would even consider ""the amount of Decred transactions made during an event"" as a success metric. Crypto sounds good in theory but when you actually _send_ or _receive_ it the magic happens.
- ""Full Monthly report"" this is great, somebody has to challenge Ditto as the best reporting entity!
- Good to see you're building that Facebook and Instagram presence. As much as I dislike how those platforms operate, IMO it's very important.

Questions:

1. I heard that Portuguese speakers can read Spanish content because the languages are similar. Can you please comment on that, is it the case or does Portuguese require its own outreach program?
2. Does this budget cover moderation of Spanish social media spaces?
3. ""User Support"": what do you think about making `#support_es` Matrix room? Would it help people with technical issues better if they could speak in their native language?
4. I'm cautious about investing efforts in centralized platforms because they have demonstrated that they _all_ can collude, coordinate, and shut you down everywhere (social media, payments, banking, hosting, even domain names) if you say something that makes them really upset. For people who don't prepare and trust these platforms to connect them with their audiences it is a huge loss every time. I think Decred is not there yet, but one day it may be. Not because Decred will become radical, but because the platforms will become more crazy. How do you take these risks into account to minimize the damange of possible account censorship or shutdowns?
5. To what extent existing Spanish outreach was funded by Dustorf's Marketing and Events proposals, and what was the motivation to branch off?
6. Will you always invoice $12,000 monthly or is it just the maximum amount while the actual amount varies?
7. Does your reporting plan include writing reports for most expensive events? For context, I'm having a growing bias against big events because I have no idea if we get anything out of them. It would be easier if there were more reports, each reflecting on whether it was a good expense.
8. In the comments you noted that Talend Land is the biggest event taking about $12-15K. With your experience of attending the same event in 2018, do you think it pays off?",420cab16bd4efd92ad1286ab8ef9ff4da75a60f1220ae2be985db4f3630c8a26b543c0f75f2b101213d943a90f709f0a300c8111bb5501c7c4d975476fceab00,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,11,cd0ce9ea04652d091164137b2583db2e8238710b322ce44f42bdba09693c079059581aa426e7dbe1df905513b2715092f7d843f98cfe9617d4994c44ea17cf02,1573825842,2,2.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

Thanks for your comments and questions, let me go through them:

On notes, 

I agree that we are early for mainstream MoE usage, however, it's something clearly down the line in DCR lifetime. We need to start working on how this will play out (this is the reason for my interest in BTCPAYServer https://pastebin.com/x1ywLDwu).

Also, on FB, IG and alike platforms, on a conversation with DCRComic team we recognised that in order to build this ecosystem we need to go where (future) users are. 

On questions, 

1- Although Spanish and Portuguese share their origins in Latin and are very similar, I think Brazil needs its own tailor made strategy, it must be done in Portuguese and according to the local experience of users that are engaging with digital currencies. We look forward for more collaboration and for this proposal to serve as an idea for a dedicated Brazilian strategy. Decred Brazil has been an example for us on adoption, community building and brand awareness. 

2- Yes, moderation in Spanish social media accounts is part of the contractor hours budget.

3- #support_es is something that I look forward as Decred’s Spanish community grows, at the moment I think #DCR_Spanish works well as the first point in Matrix to reach the Spanish speaking community. Furthermore, we have the pleasure of having davecgh on the channel so we have some hardcore knowledge sorted for the Spanish speaking community.

4- One of the priorities of the team will be to mirror all the content that we have created into a public repository, both for record keeping and censorship prevention. 

5- The activities of Decred en Español during 2019 were funded by Dustorf’s Events and Marketing proposal. The motivation of this branch is to further decentralise decision making, enable more operational autonomy and to set a useful precedent of a dedicated geographical proposal that could serve to create tailor made strategies for local contexts.  

6- The idea is to bill $12,000 every month and disclose expenditures and the distribution of the funds, which I expect will change on a monthly basis. With the exception of contracting hours which will account for 50% of monthly budget.

7- I think that for reporting purposes we will register every meetup/presentation/event with their respective expenses. Monthly reports will be the base for a full activities report at the end of the proposal period. 

8- I agree with you that is hard to measure the impact we have in big events. In our experience with Talent Land 2019, the event was a fantastic opportunity to connect with the Mexican professionals working in the crypto industry. This set the ground to establish Decred as one of the leading projects working in Mexico and Latam. I recognise that paying for the sponsorship of Talent Land translated into social capital that allowed us easily organise many of subsequent events throughout contacts with the industry that solidified during the conference. 

At one point of Talent Land, Decred’s booth was THE spot to be, some of the names that visited our booth: Christy Choi director of Binance Labs, Luis Quilo community manager Binance Latam, David Puell from Adaptive Capital, Tone Vays, Jose Rodriguez VP of Bitso Exchange, Lorena Ortiz owner of the Bitcoin Embassy Mexico, David Noriega CEO of Taurus Exchange, David Yao director of Blockchain Land at Talent Land, Ernesto Contreras community manager Dash Pay, Marco Sanchez from Bull and Bear Trading Academy, Issac Philips CEO Siglo Blockchain, Abraham Cobos from Naos Blockchain Capital, Omar Zaragoza CEO of Kapytal Exchange, Jamal Zyat from Singularity University, Diego Ramos from Ramos, Ropoli & Schuster Law Firm, Diego del Olmo from BBVA Mexico (largest bank in Mexico), Rodolfo Diaz CEO Domitai Exchange, just to name a few.

Regarding the questions you mentioned:
Q- What will happen when you work less hours or have little operational costs? will you still bill the full $12K to the treasury?
A- The idea is to spend the entire budget in any given month during the time frame of the proposal. As mentioned before, the team that will be working in this proposal is made of 7 members with intentions of adding 3 more. Given that around 50% of the budget will go to contractor hours at a rate of USD 30 per hour, we have around 200 man hours monthly to split between the current team in Mexico and Argentina. As per the Operations budget the aim is to fully use it for all related activities happening at any given month or in subsequent months (as mentioned, in some cases, like Talent Land 2020 in Abril, the budget will be drown from several months and payments will be made in advance to organisers and local vendors). 

Q- How can the monthly report be used to check whether the billing is in line with the actual value delivered to the project? 
A- On one hand, I see the monthly report as the Proof of Activities and Proof of Expenses of Decred Latam operations. On the other hand, I recognise that is hard to measure the added value these operations will have on the project in the short term. From past experience, it was really hard for me to see where the added value of my work was until months after my first meetup and activities. It is up until now that I see how those 37 meetups/presentations/events have build awareness of Decred in Mexico and Latam. 

Going back to my personal roadmap for the project in January 12th, 2019, I was wrong in having as an objective to get fiat integration right away, first we needed to build a community that want to have a DCR market in their country. This has been the actual work during 2019, creating markets that desires DCR. This is the last line of my roadmap: ""I am looking forward to expanding DCR presence in all the Spanish speaking countries and grow our community base in Latam"". I see this proposal as continuation of this effort and, if approved, as a proof of our successful operations during 2019.

I have no problem with anything in the proposal except the billing.

To quote the proposal

> Budget: The total budget of this proposal is USD $72,000 divided by 6 monthly payments of USD $12,000 and the time frame of action is between the approval of this proposal and 6 months afterwards.

As someone who has been paying for expenses related to events via C0 and overseeing contractor work for a couple years, I think it would actually work to your and the project's advantage to have a budget of USD 72,000 for the next 6 months, versus having a series of fixed payments of USD 12,000 per month during that period.  My experience is that when you are paying someone a fixed fee for a service, their incentive structure changes quite a bit, e.g. they may see fit to terminate or reassign staff or be stingy with expenses.  Despite the Ditto PR proposal having this structure, it is the exception and not the rule, and it is also a direct consequence of there having been no independent PR contractors.

After paying for several events via C0, my experience is that the costs of events have very non-uniform timing, e.g. you end up spending a whole lot in a short period of time with the sponsorship, accommodations, transportation, and staffing.  If you take the payments in fixed amounts each month, you take on the exchange rate risk of holding those funds, which results in a bad outcome for the project if the exchange rate drops between you receiving funds and you using them to pay for fiat-denominated expenses.  In the case that the exchange rate rises between receiving funds and spending them, the project ends up overpaying for the work.  I see both of those scenarios as undesirable for the project, despite there being an upside for you in the event that the exchange rate rises.

For the reasons cited above, I have a strong preference for staying away from fixed fee proposals and instead favor fixed budget proposals.  I see absolutely nothing wrong with drawing the full budget amount from a proposal.  Paying for contractor expenses in arrears, versus upfront, makes it much easier to audit the work being performed and insulates the project from risks associated with prepayments.",dedc60c1b9fbf206cd958959352245f9f55c55ffc5d99d1ef9fd208048ac72b24cdded23913079c244d75dd34b17056e83f7cbc43d2a1c5b6fcbbd6f2833be0b,e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360,19,a50ebc33c0aa16d4db35873a1d50cc1a319c6d3b5fd8425e717a05e50c1c5839cb0908a6caf7d82847d28b64e64323bebd10d889049003f058a8e844fb8cda0e,1574045128,4,4.0,False,fe62dd6a-2cc6-4d41-abd0-522528d33ae7,jy-p,

Of course, overall I think that the budget is set to be split 50% contractors hours and 50% operations. I think contractor hours will be the most stable part pf the budget.

As per the operations, it really depends on the type of events and how we manage to make it. From past experience I could say that the Ops budget is divided 40% travel expenses, 40% sponsorships and 20% marketing materials. Some times we can cut some expenses trough our network (venues for example) and reduce costs, is hard to say exactly as it really depends on the location and type of event. 

In the case of Talent Land, which is the biggest event that we are planning, the ops budget will go into the range of 12k to 15k, in this case, small payments will be done on a monthly basis from the budget received. During our presence this year the expenses were divided around 40% sponsorship, 40% travel expenses (transportation, accommodation and meals) and 20% in swag. This is by far our biggest expenditure expected for the 6 months budget. 

Best!

Thanks for your comments, I think that this is a good way to proceed. I'm wondering if you think this is the best way to deal with sponsorship payments and travel expenses in cases where these amounts complicate contractor paying in expectation of a refund? As you mention, cost of events have non-uniform timing that makes variations on the monthly expenditure. Nonetheless, is possible to budget and schedule payments in advance in order to get ahead of expenditures having volatility in mind. 

There are several events (Labitconf Uruguay in December, Blockchain Summit Latam Panama in March and Talent Land Mexico in April) that can be budgeted early in advance for the Treasury to make direct payments. The monthly bill may change from month to month according to our activities, but as you mentioned before, is important to be careful with volatility and exchange rates.

Maybe a better description of the budget could be: **The total budget of this proposal is USD $72,000 that will be used through the time frame of 6 months that this proposal will last. Contractor hours will be billed to the Treasury in arrears and after work is completed. In cases where there is bigger payments to sponsorships or travel expenses, this can be schedule in advance on a monthly basis. **

Let me know your thoughts, best!

1. How do you know this is effective? Can you present numbers that support the effectiveness of the project so far? What's your metric (number) of success?

2. Since as you say 5 of the top 10 countries where crypto is used are in Latin America, then crypto is already used there!  And it's growing there faster than in other countries: they're in the top 10.  So *why focus on more effort there*? If Spanish speaking countries are more social than other countries, maybe the message is spreading faster there anyway. I don't have numbers to support this, but I didn't see numbers from you to support the opposite either.

1. The effectiveness in this type of actions is something complex to measure as most of the time the relations we build take time to cristalise into material benefits. At the moment we have the records of greater participation in events and hard metrics of Decred's social networks in Spanish that can be taken as an example of the tracking that Decred en Español is having. Take into consideration that before I arrived to the project there was nothing in Spanish, now we have a selection of active social media and an audience that is following the project because there is content in Spanish. Furthermore, I've find that in order to position Decred as a global currency we need to have dedicated content for every region and local context in the world. Otherwise we could have the best technology in the space but if no one knows about it it doesn't make much sense. 

2. Indeed, crypto has a great adoption in this region and although it is not the most populated part of the world is where there is a greater presence and more adoption opportunity for projects other than Bitcoin such as Decred. As adoption is growing in the region we must foster our efforts to build brand awareness of what is Decred and why it matters, we cannot leave the region and wait for people to find about Decred on their own, we must go there and present the project. Why being present is important? Because in Latam you'll find more use cases than any where in the world, from remittances (the flows from the United Stated to Latam are among the biggest flows of money in the world), protection of wealth against hyperinflation (Venezuela is the most extreme case but Argentina is also experiencing a similar phenomenon),  corporate and government use of blockchain technology (almost every country in the region is experimenting with blockchain technology), cryptocurrency user adoption (we have around 1 million users of cryptocurrencies in Mexico alone) and friendly legal frameworks that are allowing a variety of business related to cryptocurrencies and blockchain to flourish. 

I agree with you that there are larger regions in the world that we need to focus as well, I think this proposal could work as an example of how a regional effort to grow Decred's brand awareness can be implemented. Particularly in the case of India is important to take into consideration that the legal framework for cryptocurrencies is not friendly and on the contrary there are restriction to cryptocurrency ownership and trade. Any plan towards India must take into consideration this reality. Furthermore, we want to position ourselves as the first monetary alternative in the region and take advantage of the rapid growth in this industry in Latam because we have the knowhow to do it and because there is a friendly environment to make it happen.

In my opinion, the current proposal is missing one element: delivery milestones. It would be great if you could specify how we can ""measure"" whether the budget you are billing each month is actually contributing to Decred's success in the region. 

The proposal mentions a few activities in the ""How"" section: Spanish content, marketing of Decred on social media, networking with key players in the region, headhunting talent, organizing and attending events. It also mentions two main expenditures: contractor hours and operational expenses (marketing materials, travel costs and sponsorship/organization of events). In a reply to exitus it was mentioned that the budget is set to split 50% contractors and 50% operations. Based on these projections, actual expenditures in a month would look like this:

* $6K was paid to employ ? full-time people and ? part-time people
* $2.4K was paid to contractors for travel expenses
* $2.4K was paid to event organizers for sponsorship fees
* $1.2K was paid to company XYZ for marketing materials (swag)

It seems to me that the ""Full Monthly Report"" would be used to evaluate whether the full $12K should be awarded for the work delivered in the past month. To do so, we need clear delivery milestones that can be used to review the work. Without delivery milestones it will seem like we are just sending money to Latin America and ""trust"" that the people on the ground will spend it wisely (which could also be a good strategy), but **I'm curious whether the activities you mentioned can be captured in delivery milestone(s)**?

For example, perhaps this is what a successful month could look like:

* added 3 Spanish articles to major publications
* added 120 followers to Spanish DCR social media
* added 6 key players to our mailing list in the region
* attracted 3 new developers to the project
* organized 3 events to educate people
* attended 3 events to promote Decred

Another insight I would like to have, is **how do these delivery milestones link back to the strategic objectives mentioned in the proposal**? (Awareness - Adoption - Decred Expansion)

But I wouldn't expect that people who have worked on building Latam presence and know it well will switch to India or any other region.",b336f9b80b0c7ce99bb17b01ce7915f18cd1c7ffac7531eebe3cf65c1fcb5e763f089ba93334ed8512b5fc87b7b4770c6cc6b8ed7ec9003029c8b31bf609ee03,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,30,4c9b94f78eccb68a57bf8fad6ab7eaf4f8558f9b4c543577d92530902ce6a94c4596561864ce18f3f811da8c04fce657ab6ec3810984c1c6a3d06db6446b5201,1574700044,1,1.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

Thanks for your comments and questions her are some thoughts on them:

For milestones and success measurement I see several metrics for monthly reports:
    - Number of monthly events
    - Number of new followers on Social Media, leads and interactions
    - Number of new users on Riot/Slack/Discord, particularly in the Spanish channels
    - Downloads of Decred wallet in Android and iOS from Latin-American countries 
    - Visits to decred.org from Latin-American countries (these two points require support from DCR web admin team and mobile wallets devs to know this details)
    - Mentions in cryptocurrency news outlets in Spanish 

The aim is to keep the pace, exceed our activities in Latam and the full monthly report will be a good way to measure the activity of Decred en Español and the advancements of our actions.

In relation to projected expenditures, as mentioned before I recognise the contractor hours as the most stable part of the budget. These contractor hours will be given to the entire team for work done in a part-time fashion and in arrears. 

As per the operation expenses I think this will variate depending on the activities/events we see on the agenda. One example is Talent Land 2020, this event will require the entire operation budget for almost three months as the expenses will be in the range of 12k-15k, in this case the payments to the organisers of Talent Land will be make on a monthly basis, as we did for Talent Land 2019. I imagine that there will be months in which our entire operation will be in our local cities, in this cases there would be no travel expenses or they will be minimum. An important part of the full monthly report will be to shown all our expenses in a detailed manner and to serve as an agenda of our activities.

Regarding how the milestones are related to our strategy of “Awareness-Adoption-Decred Expansion”, I think that social media metrics is the first step to measure brand awareness of Decred. Events add up to this but go into the next step which is adoption, as we invite our audience to download our wallets and start getting in contact with our tech. The next step I see for adoption is measured by how this events attract new users to our social media. These two point have a synergic relation and both complement each other. 

I think the natural consequence of this two steps is the organic expansion of the project in a decentralised fashion. As an example, after the work we have done during the past months we have seen  new social media accounts being created without us having any interference (Decred Venezuela and Decred Paraguay). At the end of the day this is the kind of organic Decred Expansion that we are aiming to grow. We recognise that Awareness-Adoption-Expansion is something that can be fostered but not forced. Furthermore, the aim of this strategy is to set the grounds for this organic expansion. 

As per headhunting activities I've followed the principle of ""people who sign up as contractors proactively"" as the first filter to invite new contributors. All the team has been proactively engaged in the project and in the Spanish social media for months already: adcade, francov_, luisantoniocraig, victorarubin, camilolwi, tomee, nachito and pablito (pablito and nacho are not mentioned in the proposal as they presented DCRComic and have been granted resources to work, other wise the proposal would have taken them into consideration), they all engaged in the project before I invited them to collaborate.

When I've tried to bring people that didn't engage before hand has been a failure as they lack the interest, curiosity and passion to get deeply involved in the project, which by itself its complex. I recognise that proactivity is the best filter for headhunting talent, people need to demonstrate a deep interest and knowledge in the project, after that the rest comes naturally. As per the proposal, I want to headhunt more talent in Latam but I'm waiting for them to come to us rather than the other way around. Specifically, I’m looking for talent in Spain, Colombia and Venezuela.

Thank you for your patience and feedback. This has been a pretty interesting experience. Moving forward, I would like to update the proposal and make some comments regarding doubts and concerns. The first thing I would like to address here is that many comments were made regarding the duration of the talk. It seems that people did not understand the entire scope of my proposal, that the presentation in itself was a part of a multi-staged process, which now based on the new material should be evident.

Some members were questioning my involvement. It seems there was a lack of clarity on that aspect.  I think its best to clarify with past contributions.

**Past involvements: **
I started Bittopia back in 2017. I have a meetup group which now contains over 200 members. This was very active when I was living in the Netherlands. You can see the below events which I hosted in collaboration with Haon, who has been one of the most supportive members and the key person to introduce me to Decred. I must give many thanks to his support and contributions.   
Meetup, December 12, 2017 (Utrecht, Netherlands): https://www.meetup.com/BitTopia-Blockchain-Made-Easy/events/245693754/
Meetup, Feb 13, 2018 (Utrecht, Netherlands): https://www.meetup.com/BitTopia-Blockchain-Made-Easy/events/246681062/

**My promises as per proposal:**
- Decred will be included in my talk and presentation from the perspective of decentralized governance, funding, and exchange.

- Discuss Decred during other talks (interviews/discussions).
https://youtu.be/dq2SGpI5-Gw?t=1357
- Produce an article in relation to the event, including what Decred brings to the table.

- Marketing and merchandise promotions.

- Speak to individuals who are interested in using or developing with Decred and bring them to the community.
See article. 

I have also prepared a report which will be sent to Haon to distribute to key members. This explains my analysis of the proposal system as well as other elements which I believe should be reviewed from a usability and integrity perspective. 

Moving forward, I have decided to pull the proposal and request donations instead. I hope this work goes to show my integrity and desire to collaborate with the Decred community. If you believe my work had value and you would like to reward me for it, please send DCR to the following address:

Like all Decred stakeholders, I love when people say nice things about Decred, especially well-known and well-respected figures.

That's where my positive take on this proposal ends.

My opposition to this proposal is based on the following opinions:

1. ~2000 USD is way too much for 4 minutes of talking nice about Decred, no matter who you are and what your motivations are.
2. It's dangerous to pay anything at all for just talking nice about Decred.  Motives will always be in question if the precedent is set that random people can get paid for mentioning Decred in a positive light.

Now, people do get paid for speaking on behalf of Decred at conferences and other events.  What makes them different?  In almost all instances, they are either (1) known contributors in other areas like development, design, etc. (2) explicitly hired to perform PR functions (i.e. DittoPA) as part of a broader awareness and education campaign, or (2) established community members who are notably NOT known/important/repsected/blah/blah/blah people in crypto.

Thought experiment: Say Pomp (Anthony Pompliano) proposed to get paid 500 USD every time he said ""I like Decred"".    How about 50 USD?  The value in that would be ZERO (0) if he were getting paid **at all** for it, but immeasurable if he did it for other reasons (you know, he like the project and were perhaps a stakeholder).



No.

In my view making the proposal is the right way to resolve this. I personally don't think the Treasury should pay $2,050 towards this though, because for me the cost is too high and it could appear as paying people to insert Decred into their more general talks.

In my view it's fine for the Treasury to fund people going to events to present and represent Decred, but I'm more comfortable when they are people who know some aspect of the project very well talking about that. Being funded to give presentations about Decred should be a small aspect of a larger role within the project, in my view.",bf8c91cd75a16f269deb06a37b502ae045c727497e456ab8a5eb6093017f10abcf36857da26f53a5d370a4c26db758065e93ca2bf6fefe6c7951c6f19d1e6801,cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e,2,7a0ec37887934a5d024c8e10f42162ce507833655535759b2e87f6f49126997ebc03d799f65fa7bc0b3b6b87e156d4ec385f45ccea3b3b4dbbbd7c4b69e85409,1570579630,7,7.0,False,350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c,richard-red,

Amin's speaking skills are good, topics covered are very important and aligned with what Decred aims to build. Decred part starts at [4 h 26 m](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYkIyUaRG0s&t=4h26m06s) and ends at 4 h 30 m, so about 4.5 min in total. The coverage was good and presented Decred to a very relevant audience (I'm a fan of the idea to present Decred at [hacker](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/83)/decentralization/sovereignty-oriented conferences and OPT-OUT looks like a good fit). The whole talk ends at 4 h 51 m, giving Decred about 10% of the total talk time.

Without knowing what % of the non-talk activity was dedicated to Decred, I'm not sure it is fair to position the cost as covering 50% of expenses. On the other hand, $2K doesn't look like a crazy amount for a speaker like Amin.

Questions:

- Were you networking for yourself or for Decred? If the latter, how Decred community will gain access to connections made during your networking time? Just thinking how Decred can capture the results like this since this activity is included in the cost.
- Was there a stand or booth with Decred branding?
- In general what rough % of your trip was dedicated to representing Decred?

Regardless of how this proposal goes, I hope you captured the evidence (video/photo) and I'm looking forward for a write-up about your trip in the context of representing Decred. This can be later used to negotiate a reimbursement. Disclaimer: I'm not managing Treasury payouts or the Events 2019 budget, just observed that it is a common practice to request a reimbursement once the work is proven to be useful.",c666bf147649d381114bb285e21e490a87e33217272f3fd8e07eacee2ebfe06e5296a5891c131b9ae1390577210c82b0cac3d394038b423f090d0e53f89b0e02,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,4,82cceb476e830a9dd196489634712bc3408c9ab18439abb75b1976aa910d3c5319c65dae1b40fc9894d6513118c1214d882de604fc278a65d3ba31e9ca737c0c,1570906240,1,1.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

This case demonstrates a possible gap in our org structure. If person managing certain proposal's budget does not trust a new person and is unwilling to experiment, the new person cannot access that budget. His choices then are to seek other budgets and negotiate with their owners to ""host"" his expenses, or make a proposal and create a new individual budget for himself. There are pros in cons in both options. First one means we need multiple, ideally cooperating, events budgets. If one rejects to host you, you go to another. This is not necessarily bad but it is more complex and we simply don't have that right now. Second means that all small compensations that are declined need to go Politeia. This is also not necessarily bad - it is good (in fact, amazing) that we have _some_ way to definitely resolve this, it introduces new people to the stakeholders and implicitly raises the issue I just described. The downside is friction and the risk of flooding Pi.

To be clear, I'm not criticizing proposal owners who reject to cover requests like this (Dustorf in this case). Their reputation depends on how well they manage funds trusted to them. If I were in such a position, perhaps I would often lean towards the safe side and not host expenses of new people until I'm really, really sure they do the job. My point here was to outline the challenge of funding small and new initiatives in our current system.

Perhaps we just need a few more umbrella marketing/events proposals with different strategies.",018c8e9324fbe42eccb16c2a318608bd8c4bc63896f5fd5e152416a434382c3c557156a1e2089b45bd7fe8011ed2a4532b17e0357022e8666ea62c95aee5f209,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,6,2dabbee0056ed2a70d46e6c49352960f0ebc183e4c4f2b0b51c5bf439827b0949ab6dbc63747768851255977bd489f147b13cb17b09792d7d08c9e20ef96390e,1570906964,3,3.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

I think it's an interesting idea and I agree that there is potential for a greater connection between cryptocurrency and e-sports.

There appears to be a [deCRED twitch channel](https://m.twitch.tv/decred/profile) but it has no videos, I don't know who operates it. I looked at your twitch channel and it seems to be empty, no videos, clips, followers, past or future events. This leads me to question whether the games would be able to attract any significant audience. 

Are there established DotA 2 channels that host cash games? Have such games been hosted with cryptocurrency prizes before?

Twitch is huge and exposing Decred to that would be great. Did anybody know that Twitch has its own internal currency (Bits - not Bitcoin Bits) that users use to tip each other? Streamers earn money with it. From what I gathered, one Bit costs about 1.4 cent and 1 cent goes to the gamer. I guess the rest goes to Amazon that owns Twitch? I'm seeing an opportunity for crypto here.

This proposal highlights the need for funding and trying [small things](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/33) without the need to bother all stakeholders. Perhaps we need an experimental marketing budget?

As for this proposal, if stakeholders are skeptical I would advise some combination of the following:

- Consider these rules:
  - only bill the Treasury if the game collects enough players and actually takes place
  - revise the idea if 2-3 games in a row fail to collect players and fail to start
  - optional: bill less if the game gets less than X views
- Try to fund this idea through other means because Treasury is just one possible source of funds:
  - ask existing marketing leads if they would fund this experiment through their budgets
  - ask in #proposals chat and on Reddit if anybody would donate to run 1-2 games and see the results before continuing
  - keep in mind that only 20% of eligible tickets have voted so far, which represents only 10% of DCR
- See if you can regroup and build up some support before trying another proposal.
- How about StarCraft 2? Just an idea.
- Don't give up too easy!

We would like to mention that we have described the system in the way clear to community, as for user experience, there will be no need to understand the blockchain and Decred (unless used decides to do it by himself), the system will be designed as described, user will be able to pay with credit card and receive «Decred Bonus Points» which will be actually focus him on Bonus points. As well, we have an accurate understanding of discounting systems and platforms and how they works, especially in Ukraine and EEU/CIS countries. The key feature for user will be possibility to increase discount every time he use app, that is far better motivation of spending fiat that purchasing any kind of in-game item, for example.

Also, while we are thinking in this way, while we are afraid to introduce such futuristic ideas into real life, we remain a speculative community more than technology evangelists, voting further and further for another round of order-book refill, instead of evolving the technology and not bringing life in it, but bringing it to life. It goes without saying that market making and alternative things are important, but since everything is fine with it now, it is time to introduce something new. Because it is easy to discover by opening approved proposals that there are basically more abstract things, such as numerous researches that the average user is not able to feel. But to drink a cup of coffee branded with the logo of Decred is simple and effective. Already at the stage of discussion with the community, we see a certain resonance, which had already come from the Ukrainian business for some time. Isn't that good? We are convinced that the future should be created by people, not by the passage of time. Therefore, we are here.

As for Dash, they already are connected with products like Paytomat, and they actually also cover some CIS and EU restaurants, we did a thorough research and we exactly know volume of transactions in their system for some of restaurants, it is indeed not big (less than $5,000 monthly), but promising already. Anyway, if Dash fails to insert their business model and technology in one way or other, why does it mean that Decred will go through the same way? We would not like to breed a philosophy on this topic, but we think everyone understands that many projects tried to implement the same ideas, but only those who differed from the others really came to success. For example, such a parallel can be drawn in relation to the online-taxi and Uber - they were not the first to try to realize this idea, but we see the result ourselves.
As for coffee points, we will not try to insist anyone to buy crypto, but we will make customer buy it to cover his willings without any minute of delay - as fast as he usually pays with his Visa/MasterСard, as we already has a solution for it.

The difference is not to give an option to pay with crypto, but to give benefits to those who hold it/buy it/spend it. It was clearly described in our concept. The concept of cumulative bonuses is a tested time, so we have no doubt about the chosen model.

I see two issues with such approach. First is our community is small and each person has a limited attention span. Second is it is an untested assumption that ""crowd"" will engage in making decisions for this particular project. I recommend negotiating with people who will work on this and including their names in the proposal.

> The whole use case sounds complicated. Buy DCR with fiat only to then spend it in cafes with a discount? Why not just buy coffee with fiat? This hassle eats people's time, there must be a very good reason for them, like a huge discount.

Basically it is inspired by effective products that are active in CIS area (ex. _Pokupon_ where people buy subscription to receive discounts and gifts). People will be motivated to make each payment as each 1/3/5 payments through app will _increase_ their discount as it should be in loyalty program.

> Consider a ""test run"" in a very small scale - this will have more chances to get approved. Why not test one cafe first? Besides, that will be a good way to find missing features or pain UX points in using DCR in point-of-sale scenarios.

First of all, let's divide loyalty system app and handling own branded points. App will be working in all points and further not only in this brand. 
Also, building points it is a default model of franchise, but branding it costs each month of them being branded, which is a big cost for a long run. By purchasing franchise points in the amount we mentioned (15 totally) we negotiated to make them branded for free without extra charge, so that is a minimum amount to make this work without a need to pay monthly for branding. In addition, from the calculations in description you can see that we initially agreed with the franchise on a discount that saves $32,000 for the fund. Thus, the amount saved covers application development as well as marketing activities.

> Talk with Aroma Kava and verify your assumptions. Are they interested?

As mentioned, we have a direct networking connections in this area and segment, this is settled. Thanks to this we agreed on exclusive franchise conditions.

> Why not just build a network of point-of-sale systems with ""DCR accepted here"" labels, without complex loyalty programs?

> This is not what I want people to buy DCR for. I want people to know exactly why DCR exists and what it is made to protect against. I'm concerned that if we ""hook up"" people to the wrong reasons, they will leave as quickly as they come in.

That will be hard to push live, as just a POS-instrument audience will not engage so much as stats of projects that tried shows. In this way, this product will not be interesting for restaurant brands. But making people be encouraged by loyalty program makes them already be in the system of DCR, and there is more chance to engage them into the project itself. Consider this as some kind of remarketing audience.

> Some parts of text are hard to read and understand. I recommend to improve the translation. It is not just the initial proposal you'll need to communicate. Imagine if it passes - you will need to talk with the community a lot, and clearly communicate your ideas.

We will work on this, thanks for mentioning. This is a valid point, because most of our team members are not native English speakers.

> How any profit is made if Decred is subsidizing discounts for the buyers?

Profit is being made mainly by points sellings. As we are making discounts, we still will have lots % of margin left as a revenue. Common price markup in coffee area in Ukraine is 250-300%.

> Is ""Decred Bonus Points"" and ""DCR"" the same thing or two different units?

Same thing. Just named a Bonus Point for user understanding, would be equivalent to DCR, basically it would be DCR, but app will show it as Decred Bonus Point.

> Why a coffee shop would bother with all the trouble and sell products cheaper than for fiat?

All operational issues will be handled by us. Also, as mentioned with Pokupon example, it is a common way in Ukrainian restaurant business to attract clients by discounting. For example, one of the biggest pizza groups in Ukraine (Mister Cat) makes 50% discounts on all pizzas to attract clients. In this connection, they actually have no competitors in their segment. By the way, we have direct contacts with them too, so in the future their network may be added to the application. We also looked at them to open a potential crypto restaurant, but Aroma Kava currently provides the best conditions for cooperation. 

> How about you take all profits to yourself but reduce the cost for the Treasury? In theory this would get you a self-sustainable business that cooperates with Decred. I don't see why charge Decred for next month if you have profits from previous month.

Probably we have indeed faced some miscommunication, **Decred Treasury will be charged only once**, after that all expenses will be held by Aroma Kava group itself and development team is also charging only once. So there will be no need to charge next months. The offer includes only costs of building coffee points and development, without a hidden margin, but with a discount.

That is a very important part, if we would reduce profits % for Treasury, it would be less attractive, and our goal is to create a case that will allow us to use this case as a proof of model and capabilities, so we will be able to create more cases like this with other brands and networks with more profitable model for us (Decred model will be exclusive), we have connections with more industries to go with such proposals. Therefore, if this proposal is approved, we will undoubtedly continue the expansion of Decred in various markets, which is quite easy to implement due to our experience and wide networking. One of the main stumbling blocks for us is the support of at least 60% of stakeholders. Already at the end of this week we plan to launch a vote, so we hope for the support of the community. And we also hope that by this time everyone will have a clear picture, since we are still faced with the fact that some aspects of this proposal are perceived in completely the opposite way than we laid it. Therefore, we will be happy to confirm or refute certain understandings of people, just want to make this offer clear.

> What is CryptoAgents? How can we check your background and ability to deliver, and make sure this is not a cash grab scam? Why did you not include any such information in the proposal requesting such a big sum?

Highly valid point, we checked other proposals and there is not much info on teams, however, we would love to present CryptoAgents. Thanks for mentioning. Being presented at https://cryptoagents.pro we are a digital agency presented in crypto area for 3 years already. Totally we helped to bring more than $200M for different projects. We already have cooperated with such projects as Bankex, NAGA, TokenClub, Lympo, BLOCKv and many others.
The team consists 11 independent specialists: marketing managers, sales managers and business developers. Nearly a year ago we have changed our strategy and started to offer our services to post-ICO projects and platforms that are already live. Currently our plan is to attract crypto projects and coins to launch offline backed business models in various ways, in this way, we would be able to state that all our work for lots of projects now makes even more sense as crypto community would be far more bigger than we could have achieved with any Forbes article or DBM advertising for eternity.

- Ukraine is indeed not the most rich country, but it has a growing potential, as well, it is quite cheap to build this type of model here as well.

Just to clarify my position, I don't dismiss the loyalty programs because I don't have data about how effective they are. I was asking to understand how it works and what motivates people.

> App will be working in all points and further not only in this brand.

Is there some standard app that provides loyalty program features for multiple companies/brands? e.g. the user has one app and one account but can get discounts in multiple places.

Is this app already live?

By ""points"" do you mean ""cafes""/""places"" or the ""bonus points"" (digital units)? It is one of the confusing terms used in the proposals.

> This is a valid point, because most of our team members are not native English speakers.

That was my guess. No problem for me, I just think many people got confused by some terms and complex sentences used in the proposal.

> Profit is being made mainly by points sellings. As we are making discounts, we still will have lots % of margin left as a revenue. Common price markup in coffee area in Ukraine is 250-300%.

So discounts and loyalty programs like this increase the sales of those cafes, they get more profit and share some of that extra with you, and you offer 90% of that back to Decred. Did I get it right?

> basically it would be DCR, but app will show it as Decred Bonus Point

Thanks for clarifying, it [was not clear](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue023/) at all and some people thought they are two different units!

If that is really DCR displayed as ""Decred Bonus Points"", does it mean the app stores DCR for the user? Does it function like a wallet? Is there an associated DCR address somewhere behind the scenes? Does the app control that DCR (by controlling the keys), or are the Bonus Points stored in your database from which you send real DCR upon request? How to ""withdraw"" and transfer DCR from the app?

> As mentioned, we have a direct networking connections in this area and segment, this is settled.

> we have direct contacts with \[Mister Cat\] too

Oh I guess this is what you mean by ""Settled B2G connections"" in the proposal. All good then. I just think stating it explicitly will be more clear for the readers, e.g. ""We have established connections with X, Y and Z"".

By the way what is B2G? Isn't it B2B?

> Decred Treasury will be charged only once

Ok this is important and we need to clarify this before the vote. Do you mean once every month, or do you mean the Treasury should send the whole $283K to you in a single big upfront payment? If you mean the latter, for your information it is not how the Treasury works for all other proposals. Payments are send monthly for the work performed in previous months, and no large upfront payments were ever made that I'm aware of. Disclaimer: I don't manage the Treasury and it would be nice if the actual managers clarified this.

In any case, this is an important part of the deal. Please update the proposal and state explicitly what schedule of payments you expect.

> if we would reduce profits % for Treasury, it would be less attractive

I can only speak for myself, but for me it would be more attractive for several reasons:

1. If you can take the estimated $38K monthly profits for yourself, you will quickly become self-funding (like in 6-12 months?). This means you can reduce the cost of the proposal.
1. Lower cost reduces the load on the Treasury. This is important in the context of recently lowered exchange rates.
1. _You_ will be the entity exposed to the risk of not having these profits, which will show that your intent and estimation is serious.
1. This eliminates any discussion about ""revenue generating activity"". I know the intent of your proposal is awareness and not revenue, but some people are confused.

Please correct if my math is wrong.

And we also hope that by this time everyone will have a clear picture, since we are still faced with the fact that some aspects of this proposal are perceived in completely the opposite way than we laid it.

To be honest I think this proposal is seriously misunderstood by many people as it stands today. Using me as an example, I don't entirely dismiss the entire idea but I'm very skeptical of this proposal in its current version.

If clarity is your goal I recommend editing the proposal text and clarifying all details that people asked about or got confused about _before_ you put it to a vote. Once the vote starts you cannot edit the proposal. As an option, you can talk to people in #proposals channel via [Matrix, Discord or Slack](https://decred.org/community/).

If your proposal receives significant changes, I would also signal it through our [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/decred) or Twitter to tell all people who dismissed this proposal initially to take a second look.

> we checked other proposals and there is not much info on teams

Many passed proposals came from people who are very well known in the community and have a good track of contributions. Although I see how this is not obvious at all, perhaps because most of our communications happen in chats (Matrix is the primary platform).

> Is there some standard app that provides loyalty program features for multiple companies/brands? e.g. the user has one app and one account but can get discounts in multiple places.
Is this app already live?

As have mentioned before, here is a popular example in CIS - https://pokupon.ua, features multiple brands, but gives only time-limited discounts. We intend to build ""buy to increase discount"" system. Yes, that is live and there are plenty of less known copies out there, though, working in the same way. You could track the traffic to make sure it is quite popular.

> By ""points"" do you mean ""cafes""/""places"" or the ""bonus points"" (digital units)? It is one of the confusing terms used in the proposals.

Thanks for admitting, it is probably unclear. By “points” we meant coffee points, physical buildings, branded with Decred and operated by Aroma Kava's experienced managers and being promoted with their channels (included in cost).

> So discounts and loyalty programs like this increase the sales of those cafes, they get more profit and share some of that extra with you, and you offer 90% of that back to Decred. Did I get it right?

Basically, revenue is being generated in another way. It comes from a sales of the point built with Decred issued cost included in proposal. The model of purchasing them is franchising. So we use the costs to build the points, brand them with Decred, and according to agreement 90% of the point income goes to Decred.

> If that is really DCR displayed as ""Decred Bonus Points"", does it mean the app stores DCR for the user? Does it function like a wallet?

Does the app control that DCR (by controlling the keys), or are the Bonus Points stored in your database from which you send real DCR upon request? How to ""withdraw"" and transfer DCR from the app? 

As wallet development would be more complicated case, it will be easier to go through the second way - hold it in one wallet and withdraw upon request using EXMO API (as it is in Ukraine and EXMO is Ukrainian exchange, as well as we have connections with Mr. Lerman (founder) that would not be a tricky process.

> By the way what is B2G? Isn't it B2B?

It is B2B, we have mentioned B2G connections (Business 2 Government) to notice that we will not have any problems to deliver such a business model in Ukraine.

Kindly thanks, we are able to slightly change the roadmap and divide the payments, thus we need as mentioned in previous comment to conduct on our side agreement with Aroma Kava on 15 points, in this way we avoid costs of branding that points monthly.

Reasonable, however mentioned revenue is supposed to be generated from all points and it is also average calculated if they are already built and open, so it would be quite hard for us to manage that without highly reducing the % of Treasury income. In this way the period of accumulating self funding would be up to 1.5y avg. Also, as mentioned, in order to conduct a deal with zero-fee for branding we will need to conduct guarantee of building 15 points with Aroma Kava, which is essential agreement that we managed to receive in our negotiations.

> By “points” we meant coffee points, physical buildings

Ok that's what I guessed. I think if instead you used [""cafe""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafe) thorough the text it would avoid the confusion (and also avoid mixing with the bonus points).

> It comes from a sales of the _cafe_ built with Decred issued cost included in proposal (...) we use the costs to build the points, brand them with Decred, and according to agreement 90% of the point income goes to Decred.

I think I'm getting it now. With money from the proposal you ""build"" the place and ""rent"" some resources of the food brand (branding, place, management, staff, equipment), in turn you get the right to take the revenue. Like you buy thousands of coffee cups with an upfront payment to the food brand, and then sell those cups yourself over time. I'm simplifying here of course.

By ""building"" in this context do you mean you physically construct new buildings and equip them as cafes, or do you ""rent"" existing cafes from the vendor (Aroma Kava in this case) and prepare them as you see fit (e.g. add Decred branding, install equipment and software that works with the mobile app, etc)? And after this ""building"", will you own the place and collect revenue indefinitely (as suggested by the Y10 profit estimate)? If yes, is it correct to say that CryptoAgents will own the place indefinitely and manage it and collect revenue ""on behalf"" of Decred (before redirecting the 90% back to the Treasury)?

> In this way the period of accumulating self funding would be up to 1.5y avg. Also, as mentioned, in order to conduct a deal with zero-fee for branding we will need to conduct guarantee of building 15 points with Aroma Kava, which is essential agreement that we managed to receive in our negotiations.

I see. So without Treasury providing the funds you couldn't start this business as quick (you would have to wait and accumulate enough of revenue to expand), and/or would be unable to negotiate a good bulk deal with Aroma Kava. In short, Decred acts as an investor that provides capital to quickly kickstart the business.

Sorry I don't use most social networks and honestly it is your responsibility to promote your proposal.

Basically. However payments through app would be easy to track in blockchain, and coffee points would be legally owned by an open type entity with an ability to publish its track records to all who wish observe, with all governant stamps standing for validating track records.

Generally. We are in negotiation with lots of coins and different brands at the moment, however we choose the most ""delicious"" and covering audience brand (Aroma Kava) to offer to Decred as we liked the system of how Politeia is supposed to work.

There is no such limitation, it is just a recommendation to have _at least_ two weeks of discussion for big budget proposals.

We do understand your position, however, we are also happy to engage in conversation. 

First of all, I would like to point out, that we strongly insist on not relate this to an invest and revenue generating activity. Indeed, we are less technical and more idea-oriented team, but as for our belief the technology needs an expansion in at least 3 main ways: awareness, backing up with an ecosystem with guaranteed revenue, scalability of usage. 

These 3 ways are about a blockchain technology itself, so why should not it be Decred specifically? 

As of our choice of suggested starting point — restaurant business is a perfect example of customer oriented market with a big area for horizontal ""module"" expansion, and coffee points  is the easiest and fastest way to approach. The choose of country is perfect.

Point 1: Awareness — that way of a case could be the loudest one in the world, probably. Anyone would agree that blockchain implementation in governant systems are interesting only for blockchain enthusiasts. But the case like this would be announced across the whole world and will have more conversion into active discussion. More awareness — bigger volumes, more adopters.

Point 2: Fiat Backing — it is always an instrument to back up any activity with a resource for expansion, even if it's technological model relies on itself. As well, as mentioned - revenue could be used for a giveaway for community members.

Point 3: Scalability (not technical) — I will not make it longer then it should be. More areas of usage — more adopters — further evolution.

Also do not forget about about the application expansion concept, as mentioned — it should not stop at a point of one brand/network connected.


We understand - that the concept and offer is not leading to development improvement directly, but we see this case as a great opening of new ways of mind for lots of projects and people in our area.

We hope that’s clear.

> First of all, I would like to point out, that we strongly insist on not relate this to an invest and revenue generating activity.

We are considering the proposal as the case itself, which main aim is not to generate revenue, but give Decred and blockchain area a new way of gaining awareness and adoption, and also an actual use case, presented by discounter system in the form of an application. So we want to clarify that the main aim is the case itself and giving a birth to a new stage of blockchain and cryptocurrency expansion, and as we are proposing to do this **THROUGH** actual offline business models coverage - indeed we need to mention that there will be income and we need to distribute it.

Why do we need voting and decentralization if the main aim of this ecosystem is just to exist, without any infrastructure being built around it? We vote for improve a network that has no actual use cases that would be still live even if blockchain technology will no longer be interesting for anyone.

But yes, we mention the revenue and its distribution, as it will appear, and there is no sense to hold fiat money on any account, neither we want to be shareholders of all income gathered through the offer, that is why we propose to use small % to develop idea further, and major % to give to Decred for any use. Our idea is very simple.

Regarding your specific feedback

- ""Retail investors"" vs ""normal people"": I think it's tough to define what ""normal"" is, as this is a bit of a personal definition. As a guiding principle, you shouldn't need to be a finance professional to appreciate the materials, but investors should appreciate how Decred can be valuable to their portfolio.

- Translating into multiple languages is certainly interesting, as this has been done by a couple of good writers. I have not built any budget for this, but if the community likes it, I can ask if any folks are willing to help. From a marketing pov, another tactic is to translate key _nuggets_ rather than _full articles_. This maximizes impact for shareability. 

- I really like the idea about Github. Will do this.

These articles not only deepen one's knowledge, they reflect well on the project. Nobody is doing deep, original thought pieces on Tron. Decred seems to demand them.

Ammarooni has also attended at least one event and represented Decred in this [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmQce50dfGY).

The proposed list of topics looks interesting, I particularly like the look of ""A study of Politea as an innovation in human governance and voting systems"".

> Unlike a software deliverable which can be measured by specs, this proposal entails qualitative research. As I explore these topics, their themes may expand or amend if it helps their macro storytelling. I believe this adaptability will turn out to be a net positive for the end products.

I agree that it's better to be adaptable and follow the interesting threads that emerge. I also value the freedom to diverge from a specified topic or question list if what I learn along the way takes me in a different direction.

> I am approaching this through a monthly invoice / pulse check rather than an hourly or lump sum payment, as academic deep dives can be more equated to share of mind rather than share of time. A $2k/month arrangement is a better representative of such a relationship.

This is a good point about ""share of mind"". It is hard to put an accurate number of hours on the time it takes to produce something like a research article, because the time spent writing is only one component and it's hard to draw the line around what counts as relevant reading/analysis time.

I find it interesting that the last 3 proposals with a research component have all specified what is effectively a monthly rate with a (fairly loose) definition of the deliverables.

I like the idea of more education and more awareness, but I see one issue we have with all such efforts. We have a growing amount of excellent content being produced, but I'm not seeing a response in view counts, likes, etc. I'm not saying we shall stop producing excellent content, but rather ramp up efforts and constantly think about reaching our audiences.

So my main question is what is your plan to get the eyeballs (that your work definitely deserves)? Where will you find them?

> Cryptocurrencies are a phenomena in economic and social **co-ordination**. While the mass public is in the early stages of understating blockchain as a financial technology

You hit my nerve here. I think human coordination is extremely undervalued by humans. Sometimes I feel the mass public is in the early stages of understanding _coordination_. The Internet opened the opportunity for unprecedented level of coordination and solving problems that were impossible to solve before. I believe sound decentralized money is the second big step. Data protocols allow to coordinate information, but that's not enough. Cryptocurrencies allow to coordinate _value_ (I call it _energy_) and power amazing projects that could not get funded earlier.

Unfortunately, I'm not seeing mass excitement and people talking about crypto everywhere, in _that way_. I mean the sound decentralized money, not those abstract ""blockchains"". (Concepts you operate has a huge perceptual impact on how distant it is from your real life.) People don't seem to understand that it is a protocol to coordinate energy that can be used to stop leaking our collective value and to direct it to solving our problems. It appears to me that people are discouraged from large scale coordination by lack of tools, centralized gatekeeping infrastructure, historic suppression of private money, unverifiable and weak voting power that makes politics uninteresting, and other factors. I mean change.org is wonderful but it's not binding and not powerful enough. Divide and conquer still works. People need to understand that we live in a great time when this can change.

I hope not all economic theories suck (""inflation is good for you!"" or ""we will debase your wealth for your benefit"") and connecting with decent ones is a great idea.

Back to the proposal,

> The material will use language that is understandable by both retail and institutional investors.

Do ""retail investors"" include ""normal people"" or is some finance background still required?

Idea: negotiate with our translators to spread the message beyond English speakers. I'm sure many of those countries are in much bigger need for sound money that actually serves people.

> The writings will be published on Medium

If you put it in Git/GitHub repo [like this](https://github.com/xaur/writings) it allows to grab all of your writings at once and easily mirror it elsewhere if it gets censored. It also gives collaborative text review and editing tools that might help you to pass it by devs (they're all on GitHub already). And perhaps Markdown is an easier format to translate from. Note that this only concerns text sources, while main published version can be Medium (like we did for Decred Journal and Politeia Digest).

> The materials will empower Decred’s current community ambassadors in outreach discussions

Related idea: establish a [standard of quality](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/48) for ambassadors.

Your past Twitter and Medium work is of high quality. Consider linking some of your tweet threads or interviews because they help to know you better.

- It is _great_ that thinkers and researchers see opportunity in Decred and actually bother to do their (extensive!) homework and come up with well defined proposals
- By attracting and retaining thinkers and researchers of this grade Decred will become even more intelligent community, a place where other intelligent people _want_ to be

Almost half of it goes into design and the other half into research and writing, so the Treasury would be paying for a designer and a writer. I don't think we can take the comic down to $500, but we could consider reviewing the price if that's main the stopper.

Regarding translations, we are trying to get the comics translated to Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese and Korean. Each one is just a few lines long so we are reaching out to other Decred community members as it shouldn't take much time. This means we cannot include translations in the proposal because we cannot force them to help us. At the same time, we are not charging for translations either. We could just hire translators but we would prefer having someone that understands the project (take into account we don't have the means to check if translations are correct).

Lastly, the one-page format limits us to short texts. The main problem I've detected here is that people are just too lazy to read. That's why we ended up with this kind of comics. I think we could test different approaches to this kind of communication, and this is by no means that final form of the DCR Comic. While we took the time to develop a strategy, there's still lots of room for experimentation.

We are looking at animations, shorter comics, longer comics, splitting the comics into tiny bits.

It really does not matter that we have one of the best tech in the crypto space if people does not find about it. This is the importance of events, marketing and community building. I think this proposal will add value in these three aspects:

- Events: DCRComic can be used to explain Decred's content specifically for newbie audiences. 
- Marketing: DCRComic can become a key tool for explaining complex topics to a mainstream audience.
- Community Building: DCRComic is a grass root effort that will portrait the inclusivity of Politeia.

Developing content is different from social media management. Our idea is to generate content that anyone in the community can use, reuse, adapt, transform or whatever they need to do.

While we don't yet have a substantial follower base to measure it's impact, the plan is not to grow the DCR Comic account, but to develop content that others, like the @decredproject acocunt or the Digest, which do have more followers can use to boost up engagement with the project.

It may sound awkward but anyone can ""test"" the comic impact by sharing the pieces we are creating. If you feel it is a good explanation, share it. Compare its performance to you other posts and let us know! I would really like to have insights on its impact.

We have plans to keep up the work. We see the comic as the first step. We would love to expand it into animated videos and new comics.

We are not contractors, but we've developed an interest in the project. From our understanding, we had to introduce ourselves by generating value, and this comic proposal kinda summarizes our work. 

Anecdotal evidence: We've shown the comic to people who are not into crypto, but ""have heard about it"", and it got them reading it and asking questions like ""Is there already a digital state on the internet?"". Again, I encourage everyone to show the comic to people and help us understand if it works.

Regarding the educational approach, we are also leaving behind a bunch of graphic assets that could be re-adapted to other needs like t-shirts, presentations, answering posts on social media. From day one we did our best to open up the development of the comic, and would love to collaborate on the strategy.

The comic serves two purposes. The first one is to develop content that the community could use in multiple ways, be it soundbites, explainers or cute_stakey.png. Reusable content is good content, like those memes that just don't die.

The second one is to show unique work. We teamed up with @nachito about a year ago, and we've been working as a creative duo mostly for projects related to the crypto space. The comic was something new and did present a challenge.  We could also do:

- Motion graphics
- UI Design
- Written articles
- Infographics
- Social media posts
- Presentations
- Project documentation

We are learning to do:

- UX Design
- Python programming
  - Algorithmic music
  - Data scraping/analysis
- 3D modeling
  - Maya
  - zBrush

We would like to keep contributing to the project. We are exploring as much as we can.

If this proposal doesn't pass, I guess we'll re evaluate the comic strategy and figure out other ways to contribute. We've been lucky to find the time to develop the comic. While we find other ways to collaborate we must keep up working with (less interesting) projects not related to Decred. Sadly, it may become difficult to keep up the pace.

Being from Argentina means we value what Decred is developing and at the same it makes us very cost-effective. If this proposal passes it enables us to work full time on Decred. We will not only develop the comic, but also dedicate more time to find those other areas where our skills are needed and contribute in every way possible. It will enable us to have (more) time to dive in and understand what the community is building and how we can collaborate.",a430eb1e86c23e21defd7188cc285e7e1883ad5a167fd9744901b5cdc43b308a2d1d020704c217bace24c89d7f643595b6e0fd9c67831dc2678d4bbe3c1cdd09,61fd66ef5eeb39a53997662796b5c0e1e47d92c8fbd540ee826cf59d9c45f746,7,75d72d6fdafa2c0f99c8751b27a188f39547815c62a363c3fa14147db911dab9e2f8bcd20b268ac9d6ae06c25a56e6a10db2eaffa12dfd76f066d593c7b24e03,1570554547,3,4.0,False,65b2d0d7-44a3-4f5d-9d45-8f6a9a9d3364,pablito,1.0

Understood.  At same time, both architects and builders have a role.  And by sharing ideas openly, maybe others will pickup on them if they truly do represent high-quality ideas.

Also, I said ""probably not me directly"" - but that doesn't mean I won't help out with leading on an indirect basis, thru inspiring, incubating, recruiting, structuring, etc.  That is my typical operating model in my life and in my businesses, which works well for me relative to my strengths, weaknesses,   and stage in life.  

>The way I see incrementalism is we get something working first, and then build a better solution while having that something working for our benefit. This is how a lot of things were done: Pi started as a central server but had brought an incredible amount of value already, the chain was started without many cool features, DEX and privacy will start as a central servers, etc.

Agree, this is a terrific description of how incrementalism works best. At same time, where we start from in the incrementalist process also matters due to path-dependency of history.  Thus if we can start closer to the optimal point in the solution space with the first iteration, chances are we'll find success faster.  

>If it does upset Pi admins and they Abandon it, the discussion should continue elsewhere (like issues). Note that if nobody develops and promotes this idea it will stall and gain a good reason to get abandoned.

Of course, we wouldn't want anyone feeling upset.  If that is the case, they should just abandon it. If the ""bias for action"" value is so strong that there is not room to openly discuss new ideas that are not yet resourced, I can refrain from sharing any ideas like this one going forward.

jz, bee, and I have all reached the same conclusion.  imho, even if we went with the $40k per month proposal, the lessons we will learn from an ""incrementalist"" standpoint are worth it, and $240k overall contract isn't going to break the Treasury, even if history does prove that it is far too expensive.

I think this is an interesting idea worth exploring.

Liked:

- novel generalized approach
- incentivizes competition from different vendors
- requires the development of verification tools that we will need anyway

Concerns:

- staffing
- verification challenges
- may fail to attract MMs
- may sow wrong incentives

**Questions, clarification, concerns**

Did you ask jz before ""assigning"" him for the job?

Staffing:

- who will build the missing automated tools?
  - checking records is a ton of not very fun work, requires tools we likely don't have atm
- who will do the oversight job?
- who will manage and push this whole thing forward? (betterfuture I assume?)

Will vendors jump through the hoops?

Oversight/verification will be crucial: is it theoretically possible to determine after the fact that MM did a good job and did not cheat?

What is the spending cap for this program? How to choose which players will fit and get paid and which will not?

Is it fair to say this is a ""market maker bounty program""?

Incentives: we are hiring a market maker out of necessity. Most other coins do it, it did not happen (enough) by itself for DCR, so we _have_ to pay a MM now. I hope that at some point DCR markets will grow big enough that a Treasury-paid MM will be no longer necessary. However, if we run this program it might train a lot of players that Treasury is willing to fund this forever.

**How I would proceed**

Right now I think we need to move on with existing MM proposals, hold a vote and secure an MM for 6 months. A lot of effort was made to bring us this close to improving liquidity, that work and opportunity should not be wasted.

During the oversight of the selected MM we will develop tools and ways that will be useful in context of this proposal as well.

In parallel with the selected MM doing his job, advance this ""MM market"" idea:

- develop this idea further: collect more feedback (incl. from real MMs), refine processes
- secure staff: find people who will do the oversight
- secure pilot budget: submit a proposal to vote that requests a small budget to test this program (can reuse this proposal)
- run the program for several months
- report on the results
- if the results are good, submit a second proposal with bigger budget

If any of the other MMs are hired now, by the time their first term ends this experiment should have some results already. If those look good, a follow up full blown proposal will be a good competition to the second term of the MM. Or it could even hire the existing MM via this new process.",8f5c5d2fad1c660d7e90101323ce6dc6e4f8a766a359598f9048a42e8059dbb735a53793306aa2d288d4d8dbb99730508145a1a969d10f6bdf521dfd8eaf2d00,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,6,b6d4137ae5486c9ac9fe757b6a730d8b53979b869be3eac7d85bffa1ab9c3e5f57dffe66a66cb82f864f49652a4e3372048aa2953a77c4d3702b8f0abe5e5209,1567292102,4,4.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

It was out of respect for JZ's role and effort in getting this MM initiative launched that I proposed he might administer it or choose a designee. He and I have been chatting about it this afternoon, and he felt that if/when the community wanted to get behind a proposal like this, it should be a contractor and not himself.

>Staffing:
>who will build the missing automated tools?

Why do the tools need to be automated at the outset.  When SEC/FINRA shows up to audit a broker dealer or ATS, a lot of the checking is manual, and they've been in the business of auditing trading operations for years. :-)

>checking records is a ton of not very fun work, requires tools we likely >don't have atm

Agree, automated would def be better!   If we were to go down this road finding a Decred MM Community Overseer with skills to automate the oversight process would be hugely advantageous!

> who will do the oversight job?

Assuming JZ is not interested, there are likely a few people in the community who would be interested.

> who will manage and push this whole thing forward? (betterfuture I assume?)

Probably not me directly. 

I submitted the proposal out of a feeling of fear for the well-being of the project and wanting to help offer another option to creating a more sustainable medium- to long-term solution for engaging MMs.

My fear is that if we consolidate to a single firm too early then it eliminates the benefit of creating a competitive environment, comparing results from a few of the firms, and being more incrementalist in price discovery. 

Also, at end of 6 months, one MM firm will have an information & experience advantage, & could potentially hold us hostage, right at the time when we need to go thru the whole process again to find a more long-term solution, which is not a favorable situation for the project to be in.   That being said, probably we can get through it OK, and the risks of not doing something at all and losing the progress we've made through JZ's process might be just as bad.

> Will vendors jump through the hoops?

imho, it is just a question of price discovery to find the price point where the market will bring us the solution that we've specified, and possibly this will go down over time as expertise builds up.

Oversight/verification will be crucial: is it theoretically possible to determine after the fact that MM did a good job and did not cheat?

Fair question.  Its worth discussing.  We have the same problem with the current batch of Tantra, Grape, and I2 proposals, btw.

>What is the spending cap for this program? 

Perhaps we can discuss this question after the first 6-month MM trial period when we have more knowledge?

>How to choose which players will fit and get paid and which will not?

I was assuming it would be first come, first served, per exchange and trading pair combination (ETPC), with a need for only one MM per each ETPC. Basically, if the MM meets the specification we've set, then they can perform the function as long as they like and get paid.   If they fail to meet any of the specs this constitutes an ""Error"" and if they commit two Errors they lose the trading pair and cannot re-bid for 30 days, and another MM can pick it up.

> Is it fair to say this is a ""market maker bounty program""?

That's a very nice refinement to the framing of it! 

> Incentives: we are hiring a market maker out of necessity. Most other coins do it, it did not happen (enough) by itself for DCR, so we have to pay a MM now. I hope that at some point DCR markets will grow big enough that a Treasury-paid MM will be no longer necessary. However, if we run this program it might train a lot of players that Treasury is willing to fund this forever.

Good point.  Maybe it should be something we review periodically? Say, every 24 months?

>How I would proceed
>Right now I think we need to move on with existing MM proposals, hold a vote and secure an MM for 6 months. A lot of effort was made to bring us this close to improving liquidity, that work and opportunity should not be wasted.

Agreed, JZ and I discussed this afternoon, and I reached a similar conclusion through my discussion with him.  Here's what I said in our chat:  ""If one of your MM proposals goes ahead, probably $240k over 6 months isn’t going to break the Treasury, and i agree we will gain significant knowledge."" 

>During the oversight of the selected MM we will develop tools and ways that will be useful in context of this proposal as well.
>In parallel with the selected MM doing his job, advance this ""MM market"" idea.

Agreed, how about we let this new proposal sit here and gather feedback for 1-2 months, including gathering feedback from MMs and expressions of interest from potential Decred MM Community Overseer candidates, and then look at it all again once everyone has had a chance to weigh in?

I don't know all the details, just added that ""position"" as a guess. Of course it can start all manual.

Automation would make the process more productive and less boring. As a bonus, having tools may attract people for the job who would otherwise reject to do it manually. I believe it is super important to free humans from tedious work to keep them creative and motivated.

> Probably not me directly.

Ok the reason I ask this is, from my experience, if you want something novel to happen, get ready to lead and put in consistent effort for months, alone. Hopefully people will join but you need to have that strong intent inside. It takes time for people to 1) see that you are serious and 2) begin to appreciate and understand the idea. Without this, I have observed many good ideas stall.

In case of existing MM work, it has that strong leadership and effort from JZ and others who have won my trust by doing, doing and doing.

> if we consolidate to a single firm too early then it eliminates the benefit of creating a competitive environment, comparing results from a few of the firms, and being more incrementalist in price discovery

I don't think so. The way I see incrementalism is we get something working first, and then build a better solution _while having_ that something working for our benefit. This is how a lot of things were done: Pi started as a central server but had brought an incredible amount of value already, the chain was started without many cool features, DEX and privacy will start as a central servers, etc.

As Decred grows it may need more and more MM services, and putting all eggs in one basket will be a bad idea. Having multiple competing contractors will always be an attractive switch.

I'd like to have MM bounty program deployed yesterday, but we simply don't have it, it requires more refinement and people, while I'd like to see MM start their work ASAP.

> end of 6 months, one MM firm will have an information & experience advantage, & could potentially hold us hostage, right at the time when we need to go thru the whole process again to find a more long-term solution

We will need to approve holding us hostage via Pi.

There is no requirement to wait 6 months and an uncomfortable position to develop a long-term solution. It can start today. In fact it has already started with this proposal. But it needs consistent effort to make it happen, now or later.

> if the MM meets the specification we've set, then they can perform the function as long as they like and get paid

Where I was getting at with ""spending cap"" question, is if a ton of MMs show up and pass all criteria, we can't pay them all. There must be a hard limit and some mechanism to decide which _qualifying_ players to reject (e.g. first come).

> Maybe it should be something we review periodically? Say, every 24 months?

That's too long for crypto space. I'd say review it every 6 months just like the bug bounty program, research, PR, etc.

> how about we let this new proposal sit here and gather feedback for 1-2 months

I support that. If it does upset Pi admins and they Abandon it, the discussion should continue elsewhere (like [issues](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues)).

This is an important, emerging issue (contributors coming to Pi for payment), and I appreciate that this comment articulates a viewpoint other stakeholders have as well. As a contractor in the trenches, who is considering a similar proposal myself, I am naturally inclined to support this proposal. However, I’m more inclined to see the project be financially sustainable. And I’m open to the idea that this isn’t the best way to fund work. Below, I’ll hopefully provide some useful context by offering my personal take on the concerns raised.

> It would serve the Decred community well to not get in the habit of funding proposal owners for past work.

So in the current contractor system, which has been successful in bringing us to this point (including building Pi), independent contractors bill in arrears for all work. And they’re given the freedom to work on whatever they want. In return for this freedom, the DAO gets a screaming deal on labor. As @muststopmurad and others have noted, no other project gets as much done for as little money. Paying only in arrears is key to that. By only paying for clearly demonstrated value, with contractors taking on the risk of work not being valuable enough to invoice for (which is often, actually), the project can reliably reward the wins. Contractors coming to Pi asking for payment is arrears can be seen not as something new, but as an extension of this model. But instead of invoices being accepted or rejected by those that control the dev fund, based on their view of project priorities, that power is being ceded to stakeholders. I can understand why stakeholders would be balking at this. But I fear they could be killing the golden goose here. If highly skilled and experienced professionals such as permabullnino can’t be compensated for work that has clearly proved valuable, the incentive to work in the DAO is greatly decreased. 

> ...it strikes me as slightly disingenuous to request funding for this work at a later date. This feels very confusing and fuzzy to me. It would be different if the proposal did not reference work done in the past and simply laid out work that will be done in the future.

This mix of past and future seems strange to me on one level. But in the context of the current transition we’re in (as detailed in above answer), it makes sense. He’s billing in arrears, which contractors are supposed to do generally. And also proposing a plan for future valuable work, which sweetens the deal for stakeholders, and perhaps soothes concerns over billing for past work (just speculating here, have never met permabull). In short, this expresses well the ambiguity of the process right now, which is in flux. 

> 2) If you intend on doing work for the DCR community in the future, then then set out a plan, wait for the community to approve, and you will potentially be funded at a future date.

Arguably this is primarily what he’s doing. If this proposal had not mentioned billing in arrears, and simply used the past work as evidence he could deliver in the future, would you be voting yes on this? $16 for future work seems like a good deal to me. Then again, it’s hard to predict the value of work in advance… There’s risk he won’t deliver, risk the work will be delivered but won’t be used/valuable in the way he speculates it will, etc…If only we could just pay for what is delivered, once we have a clearer picture of the value the work delivered…which brings us back to, paying in arrears:) 

>Let me be very clear: I think Permabull can do valuable work and should be paid for future work, but the price tag should not be higher because of the work that he has done in the past. 

Well, it does appear your comment has knocked $3k off the price. I do think that price discovery is very hard in cases like this, and that stakeholders could use Pi to negotiate. The main concern I have is that stakeholders may not want to spend their scarce time doing the hard work of valuing and negotiating every contractor’s work (and this is just the beginning). 

To be clear, I’m not convinced this is the right way to go about this. But it is in accordance with the general plan of shifting control over the treasury to stakeholders. And I think permabullnino is providing value and following expectations as best he can. An arguably a difficult task; I'm still in back, watching other soldiers charge the line.",43b958b8882009c5bcf7284bf9f347849a4098b884706190a1078122376cc95b964bd925352f81d15d9c5ddfb76acd2e294251687f8ea2e703a52697794c860c,1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73,13,ed38f4ba9961eb64eb99f5f046df8601c4e2caefdb56b232432b062bfe814bbc00afc872bfd782817af12befae2ff38036728e73656d2cf10ded95483d50d003,1568148887,2,3.0,False,107efb48-3ab1-4830-8b69-35842ca010de,s_ben,1.0

It raises some interesting questions about how we should approach Treasury funding for this kind of work though, which are worth discussing.

I have no issue with people making proposals to be paid for work that is already completed and released. This is in many ways ideal for the project, because the worker bears the risk and the stakeholders have a clear decision to make about whether the outputs, which are already known, are worth the requested amount. We want people to show up and do some substantive work before asking for payment, it's only fair that we pay them in arrears when the work is good.

I do see a potential issue here with attaching a price to a piece of research work that is yet to be completed/published and is defined by a set of bullet-points. In the case where the work is delivered to a standard that everyone is happy with, it's obviously not going to cause a problem. In the case where there is a dispute between the worker and whoever is approving their invoices about whether the work has been adequately delivered, this kind of loose specification could be problematic.

Most contractors working on Decred bill for their work at an hourly rate. When their invoices are being evaluated this anchors them to something tangible, number of hours worked. While this is not perfect, it offers a basis for dispute resolution: ""Does this deliverable represent X hours of work?""

I'm not suggesting there would be any issue with permabullnino's work specifically, but in the case where there was, the dispute could only be addressed in terms like whether the ""Evaluation of market cycles using HHP"" had been adequately addressed.

Checkmate's recent proposal had a similar issue but to a lesser degree, as it was anchored to the idea that it was for 3 months of work. Checkmate explained that their contributions up to that point amounted to 1 month of work, so that gives a reasonable basis for an expectation of what 3 more months of work should look like. Checkmate also has a fairly constant presence, which also helps to make 3 months of their work time seem more tangible.

With this proposal the timeline of 3 months seems more incidental. It is not clear to me what the deliverables will look like, how many articles and how in depth they would be as compared to permabullnino's previous output. The first version of the proposal had a split of $3K for previous work vs $21K for future work, but now that's gone and it's not clear how much new work we should expect to see for the $16.5K to have been earned.

I don't see an easy or obvious answer for how to handle these scenarios where the person making the proposal is not an existing contractor with an established hourly rate. In this case, as the work is already done and permabullnino just needs to ""put pen to paper"", some more detail on what kind of output to expect might be the best way to address the issue. For projects where the research is yet to be completed this would be more problematic, as it can be hard to predict how long a piece of research will take or where it will lead you.",9bf6daa03127eb6b03d95bb5f483c0509b9ae122ce1dd42451498cfcd55b14ca831ac57d9e81086041e215eb5e4bf105a3f4a28e32f12273f34f442b73599e00,cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e,15,055243c7003f5299a005d26b577f122fab828c72e65483840715b63c403c355cb936fe3b9a86d5053a9bff764b58c5eedf5c58188a9ff0e87cda94045eac400a,1568199339,3,3.0,False,350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c,richard-red,

Funny enough, I thought that showing up with (1) work that I already knew was valuable/completed and (2) bullet points which define the topics to be discussed would be positives. However, it seems these things have muddied the waters for people a bit, which I will consider in the future.

I totally understand people's concerns, and as a stakeholder I'm a huge fan of the attention to detail when it comes to dishing out funds from the treasury to fund work (especially for someone who isn't currently a contractor).

In all honesty, I get very anxious about asking people for money, which is why after some pushback for the initially requested $24k I lowered the amount down to $16.5k within 24 hours. In retrospect, asking for less and overdelivering is more in my comfort zone anyways.

As for past and future work - I know some people got chippy about me mentioning the amount of time I've put into past work, however I do think it's worth mentioning. When I started looking at DCR PoS on-chain data, nobody in the on-chain analyst community was looking at it or just in general going about looking at DCR on-chain data all wrong. A lot of my work was from trial and error without any other analyst's work to refer to. Fortunately moving forward, I have Checkmate available for ideation / inspiration. But the point remains, until very recently my work has been built from the ground up (which required _time_ and effort), and although it's ""past work"" it should be considered as a part of the proposal ask. 

Now, the 3 months requested in this proposal is partially incidental, but also somewhat necessary - I want to go into as much detail as possible and deliver the message with a level of quality that the Decred community is accustomed to. If I have to rush everything out the door within a shorter timeframe it might be more of a hack job. As you can see with my past work - I generally do not write quick reads.

Last of all - like I mentioned previously, I hate asking people for money. I'm also very honest with myself, if I don't think I've delivered on my promise I will know it. If people like you don't think I've done my part, I'm open to discuss the payment.

As I was going down the rabbit hole, his in-depth articles and analysis on the ticket price were yet one more fascinating tangent to go down, which taught me a lot about a complicated ticket system, and propelled me further down the rabbit hole. I think this aspect is important to note. Part of what sucks people in is just seeing really high quality work like this along the way. It teaches you a lot about the technology, but also acts as ""social proof"". The fact that someone obviously intelligent spent so much of their time obsessively going down this tangent nobody else was going down, and returned with deep insights and enthusiasm (and trading profits apparently), says a lot about the project. 

Another thing to consider is a lot of work that isn't always visible. As a die hard supporter of the project, Permabull Nino has I assume had countless conversation/debates, for instance, with a lot of other intelligent, and sometimes connected people (e.g. muststopmurad). The value of that evangelism is harder to quantify, but shouldn't be discounted. Indeed, yesterday, his work was cited in another [investment thesis](https://medium.com/@wallyhansen/decred-an-investment-thesis-bf9ba3cd1042). To get a better sense of Permabull Nino's character, journey, and experience with the project, I highly suggest checking out his recent [Decred in Depth podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxECplK3kAs), an activity he was not, afaik, paid for. 

I do think there are valid concerns about if this is the best way to fund work moving forward, which I explore in my [response](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/f0d1bd7447182328b44c691de88cb660b63df17f1f3a94990af19acea57c09bb/comments/4) to decredphilosopher's comment. I'm happy to see this discussion on Pi actually, as it will help evolve the system moving forward. I do think that voting yes on this is the right decision though. It's following the expectations put forward by the project (fuzzy as they are), offers good risk/reward, and either way gives us more data for future decision making.",06602c1ec95095cfdaab645e87da65d42e69bac4ce292011e91f7601b2cd9ed3c704f9fed9408803721b44cbd051422d91a5c884353e79664fa8cb9ae524cf09,1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73,21,fe819f4197a7cd4d05397cfd772f3fea7b94ca66ae825c23942201c16b1eb2e54ca0caf3b7ad10f09132c481f50890839d6dd7a0135b21f638fce29fb8e84101,1568308258,1,2.0,False,107efb48-3ab1-4830-8b69-35842ca010de,s_ben,1.0

First up, I believe the work Nino has done to date is excellent and an immense value add to the project. As far as skin in the game goes, he has proven it undoubtedly. I see Nino and myself working collaboratively in the future to take this to the next level for the project.

I also respect the stakeholder position that the work done to date is part of a personal investment strategy and therefore questions what is 'fund-able' by the Treasury.

I see stakeholder reservation for payment for past work (similar to my own proposal). I believe that request for an in-arrears skin-in-the-game arrears payment is acceptable so long as it is clear what is included in that fee and that it represents the minority of the total budget (e.g. I requested 2k arrears out of 14k total). 

**The primary reason I believe Decred should support SOME value of in arrears payment is to attract the the best analysts who are willing to commit risk and time upfront as well as set community expectations of value for money. The proposal should however be dominated by an outlay of further work to be billed against. **

Nino, you have clearly established WHY the work has value and your papers to date speak highly to this. I believe the 16.5k asked is a fair value for your expertise and what you bring to the community. 

What I would like to see for clarity is:
- The breakdown of what is in-arrears and what is the remaining budget you will be billing against.
- The specific deliverables you foresee (are we talking 2-3 papers? A video explainer?)
- How you plan to establish 'next steps' using this budget. What new opportunities does this open up?

In my opinion and with this clarity provided, the asked budget of 16.5k is fair and Nino will be a valuable addition to the Decred contractor community. I expect a strong collaboration following completion of both of our proposals to elevate on-chain analytics for Decred into the mainstream spotlight.",cfcd1cb42a6bfb3cdda7bf66dfe039b41ee6cf22f7f3f3c5d28249284bc46dd30d1b25ae2fb0132879d41754747bda475321b44be140ddd94e9cafb5f3161c04,ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323,25,0385e6e0d9bb809cd80c64c36889408c0753225b38247d7233281fdc20fab2e9d0d0c146b988833e3033e5345efeb4484c0b6c472f7c7efb9cbd9cfd4c7b1104,1568551538,6,7.0,False,eb486ed6-bbb3-4815-9547-599cc0f28325,_checkmate_,1.0

This is odd. What I like in Decred is the idea that decent work gets paid. It is simple, fair and powerful.

You should really have linked to your [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/permabullnino) as it hosts a ton of unique charts that demonstrate your work. Or even link to selected tweeted charts.

There are some important off-chain network health indicators like the count of listening full nodes, count of SPV wallet clients, count of VSPs, and the rate of missed tickets. Do you involve any of these in your analysis or is it purely for on-chain data?

Will you publish the mentioned suite of tools for other researchers to play with?

Are you open to publishing research on GitHub [like this](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/pi-research)?

- I updated the proposal to show that $3.5k is billed in arrears and $13k will be my budget to be billed against.

- This project will involve 4-6 written articles, average article length to be similar to my previous written work (updated in proposal as well).

- As for 'next steps', the most obvious one is to get the information included within the articles in the hands of those who would benefit from them most, the DCR stakeholders. I strongly believe this will help many manage their DCR positions during bull and bear cycles alike, so open sourcing access to these resources is a high priority. Furthermore, as you've hinted at - the combination of this proposal and your on-chain work opens up Decred to building out a suite of on-chain tools with a similar caliber to what Bitcoin currently touts (which is a big deal in my opinion).This suite of DCR-tailored data combined with the proper education of stakeholders + non stakeholders alike can be incredibly powerful, create virality, and mass buy-in to the project at large",4dae546725e5c3b726271b74ce059f827cba069590159322c5eb4abd10bca9732d6cf1fbcbc56138a8496215bfec82feb9eea83306a6a572efbdebb169b9c30b,1b71a61a2b246e60a358f3a3a9f19704e8dece58ca58f2955b1774b522bbc731,35,83dc3954b9a7df3ab0713c050a44c6d86a1182407e820c1a997d0cbc5048e321df9b0782931a35525027780fd82e879d4d3da22afd7cc77e7be1c9c7643d7407,1568664928,2,2.0,False,2d14fd6f-b0b6-4dc1-9bfa-4d6d5793da27,permabullnino,

It's not that I don't think your work would be valuable to the furthering of Decred, I just want the community to be careful about the following... **It would serve the Decred community well to not get in the habit of funding proposal owners for _past work_**. 

Seems like lots of community members are coming to Politeia to be compensated for _past work_. But **how does the community truly know a) how much work has been done in the past, and 2) what the value of this work truly is?** Permabull writes,""I’m proposing work that has already been completed.""and **It took me 12 months of research to make my initial discovery of the HHP, and another 8 months to build a full suite of tools / understanding around it, all without pay.....** -- >While the work Permabull has done is greatly appreciated, **He did all of this work out of his own free will at the time. My point is, he did not expect to be paid for this work at the time.**. **Because he did not intend on being paid for it at the time, it strikes me as slightly disingenuous to request funding for this work at a later date.** This feels very confusing and fuzzy to me. It would be different if the proposal did not reference work done in the past and simply laid out work that will be done in the future.

I hope that we, as a community, can be careful about people coming to Politeia claiming to have done valuable work in the past, and then asking/putting out a **high price-tag** because of what they've done **in the past (while they were not expecting to be paid**.

**Maybe the rules should be**: 1) If you do work and don't intend on being paid for it at that point in time, then don't ask to be paid for it later (there was some other incentive for you to do that work). 2) If you intend on doing work for the DCR community in the future, then then set out a plan, wait for the community to approve, and you will potentially be funded at a future date.  

**In my opinion, it is crucial to recognize that it is unsustainable to continue paying contributors for past work**. My guess is that Permabull did this ""12 months of research to make my initial discovery of the HHP, and another 8 months to build a full suite of tools / understanding around it"" because he is a HODLer of DCR. Sometimes that is incentive enough to do things. 

Let me be very clear: **I think Permabull can do valuable work and should be paid for future work, _but the price tag should not be higher because of the work that he has done in the past_. Although we appreciate past work, it is not the duty of the community (network fund) to compensate work that was done while the worker (Permabull) was not anticipating compensation.**",25630d95071b2d5095c152aab6fcb436caf7bbea25f410606392bf7be902d0262ff4af8b202dfc0e30b58e3190c9995c8b5a4e6e609584aa827c8430113cd00a,d94e4e3478a69860eb90f27576cc51233e8cf04b590dd3d992e5961672694aec,4,2a85d7c1ce70c3b12e4244d8db4a59321a3f45b69884082eb1e03fad1fa6b43752d0e09e51526e80ce41e4d9453661624e5fa0179fdc01a0680575f674aca80a,1567803358,3,4.0,False,1e3e9a5e-5d2d-4881-9864-999270ce0cf2,decredphilospher,1.0

I believe Nino means well and puts in effort but what a writer puts in a post doesn't matter. Only what a reader gets out of it does.

I get little out of Nino's posts.

I found the proposal fluffy too. Example of fluff: ""Educate the Decred community and crypto space at large on Decred on-chain data"". That's using fancy words to sound big and important.

How to write this as non-fluff: ""Explain Decred to people in simple words.""

As for the Decred proposal process at large, ""too many cooks spoil the broth"". When I read many comments in proposals, I get the impression the comments try to weaken my defenses, as if to trick me to think ""oh, this proposal means well, I should vote yes."" This is bad. I want to see comments that try harder to strengthen what I know. Comments that cut to the chase and address the main points.

In case this is the last time I ever post on here, I'd like to see a proposal that requires all proposals to be reviewed by an editor, with the primary goal to increase the signal to noise ratio. When I read something I want to know the most important thing about it, the explanation why it's important, and nothing else. Not at the first level, at least.

Every unnecessary word subtracts from the effect of the necessary ones.

Example: ""Why This Work Matters"" can be answered in one sentence, before it's answered in 10+ sentences. And the answer would better not be ""to help Decred"" (we all know that) but ""because X is a problem and it leads to Y"".

1. I expected some people to give pushback on the cost of the proposal. If people think it's too high then that's fine - but I'm not going to give this away basically for free. From an incentives perspective it just doesn't make any sense.
2. The cost is high due to the opportunity cost portion - one portfolio adjustment to my DCR holdings based on this info can easily net me the full proposal funding amount in a single go of it. From my perspective, this proposal is cheap (I know for some that may be hard to believe, and that's fine).
3. I'm not sure I follow your knock on coming to the table with work that's already been completed - to me it seems that it would be best to show up knowing the value of your work, and a completed product. But maybe that's just me.
4. I don't need to do this work, I've been self employed for 2.5 years now and haven't needed a dime from anybody to stay afloat. However, I believe this work going public would be incredibly valuable for the project, and thus this is something I WANT to do. Point is I don't need the compensation, and I'm not begging for money just because ""meh worked for 20 months"", although it is something for people to consider. I know my work is high quality.

1. 70% of the budget being distributed upfront is deeply problematic. This would amount to around $22,000 being transferred to people who are largely unknown to the community, with little recourse in the eventuality that you do not deliver.
1. The suitability of the local speakers to represent Decred is unknown, and the whole value proposition rests on this. To have any chance of success I think you would need to convince the stakeholders that these speakers would represent the project well.

We certainly agree that working with institutional investors is important for every project.

And we are sure that Decred will interest many “whales” or private foundations in our region, just as we hope to arouse interest among professional miners.

But, now we offer to go through the half-year stage of introducing the Decred capabilities to the whole region and introduce the maximum number of crypto enthusiasts to Decred

The presence of a long-term work plan and the arrival of foreign speakers from the Decred main team will give a good signal to the entire local community and show the seriousness of intentions,

It is necessary to understand the context and mentality of people, therefore, having a large development plan will be an important argument for institutional investors and large mining pools, and coming to each of the cities will be perceived as a sign of respect.

It seems to us that the CIS region deserves special attention and full-fledged work in popularizing information about Decred, systematic work and dialogue with local leaders of the crypto community, and of course, increasing interest in buying Decred for fiat currencies (Ukrainian hryvnia and Russian ruble) and Bitcoin on the EXMO exchange

You might know that a large number of projects have programmers and cryptography specialists from the Russian-speaking countries of the CIS

In addition, if you analyze traffic on major exchanges (for example, OKEx) or trading on Localbitcoins, you will see that interest in buying cryptocurrencies in our region continues to be great - this is due to the long political and economic crisis of recent years, which has forced people to look for an alternative to fiat currencies to save their funds

All this gives us confidence in the correctness of our decision and the effectiveness of our proposal to organize systematic work for Decred in 4 major cities of our region over the next 6 months

Once again, we express our respect for your opinion and look forward to a constructive dialogue.",dd33d49ec65643c539751fa7513c7a3bcdc87d2684823cd808244ce61bea0a6652850da7ebfe38844eb676b89008bfec3fb7cc398c33811c18a5127053e40f01,184280b7c662fa1a8291335f2329bb7e49c606ecd6cdc9f52b637ee6de5b2856,13,1eed30474d3dbb4171ea285307903729e4ce41009f857158e4a98dd2db22bc357e2b64edd5346c5b0bdcdb1d397b8e5f4f2f47b3b3514291d082acbd5d20a508,1568624973,2,2.0,False,9a7a9b5d-4fa8-4b71-9556-e465eea3f692,bogdan_rud,

 2) We are glad that you watched the first video on our channel in which we collected all the possible industries of the modern world surrounding us every day.

The purpose of this video was to work with a new audience and attract its attention, so that they highlight and remember our channel

If you study other videos on our channel on detail, then of course you will see a variety of content formats - interviews, live broadcasts, weekly news, project reviews, wallet installation tutorials, work with exchanges and others

I think that you noticed the quality of our content, wonderful sound and video, professional voiceover and presenter, an individual script is made for each video

In addition, check out the quality of the Decred videos we have on the channel.

Many people come to the world of cryptocurrencies to invest and of course hope to maintain and increase their funds, this is a fact, and therefore the profession of crypto trader exists from the very beginning of the development of the cryptocurrency industry

In many ways, it is investment attractiveness that makes cryptocurrencies famous for new people.

This is the first step for many, after which people begin to deeply study the project, the philosophy of the project and technology, go deep into the fundamental analysis, and stay with the project for many years

As you can see from our event plan, we want to give answers to all the main questions - Decred technology, legality and legal aspects of using cryptocurrency in our region, opportunities for Decred trading on EXMO exchange",820fa9e008c87c4ee16b43c770ec8f3fadcddfc674ad44cf3a698ee460e7cfba25f416f8a492ca0947a361d688adef84ca05f9f3366fbad704a6dc473bb67b03,184280b7c662fa1a8291335f2329bb7e49c606ecd6cdc9f52b637ee6de5b2856,14,d17545015b58ff0f31a0b5266724ba03e82da3d5d0c821d749801087565c9fc52b06370207f64f47fd073b02a4313c063d67044af48c30a6c95d87231396810d,1568657472,2,2.0,False,9a7a9b5d-4fa8-4b71-9556-e465eea3f692,bogdan_rud,

 i think its very very important to spread the word about Decred in countries that had/have hyperinflation.  It would be really cool to see more stakeholders from these countries. These folks know what its like when money turn into air. You dont need to explain much why decentralized money is valuable, they get it fast unlike ppl from the developed world with stable fiat. Looking at your good quality videos i can say lots of ppl in it grew up in 1990s hyperinflation. I wasnt surprised to see russians buy bitcoin from localbitcoins more than others) Im pretty sure OTC volumes there arent small either. East Europe is important hub. 
That being said i agree with other stakeholders concerns. 
-Why not one small test drive event in Kiev for instance? Four big events over 8 months is a stretch.
-Your past events look quite pro to me Id guess you can afford to fund small event then bill it in arrears. Makes more sense to me. 
I hope you can rework this prop and become a part of decred in Easter Europe.

I realize that catchy thumbnails/clickbaits are common on YouTube. YouTube promotion is not my area of expertise, but I'd like to share what taste such ""attraction"" strategy leaves for me. It basically says ""Hey _males_, HOT STUFF here! ... Now that we've got your attention, listen, crypto is ..."". I just fail to see how such signal can attract the kind of people we are looking for. Instead I'd like the ""clickbait"" message to be along the lines of ""Hey _people_, stop getting rekt by the printing presses. We are building sound money here. Join."". Although to be fair, I do realize that reacting to the second message requires much higher state of awareness.

> I do not think that it is correct to discuss the messages that speakers of other projects carry

Agreed. I was using it just as an example of a talk opener that does not align with ""Decred style"", as I perceive it.

I understand and agree that many (most?) people get their first interest in crypto to get rich, and this was part of the reason that pulled me in as well. The problem with such people is they leave just as they join when the market turns. What I'd like to see is to reach people of higher awareness (to appreciate the fundamentals of crypto and Decred), with long-term focus and the ""doer"" mindset. This will grow the solid core of contributors and strengthen the project, before embarking on wider adoption. If there are simply too few people of that kind, we should one step back and run educational/awareness campaigns about why crypto exists (to what kind of problems it is a response to).

I think the question here is which strategy is better: to ""bait"" many people on investment opportunity and then have some of them look deeper and stick long term, or to spread the core message directly.",02c94084cfd82615e3957484364d5cd48e64ed140c10b5ddaf9a9a3e2bd5a863f484e36c8b1552bd74fe94b621c853ca219e06862ddb0b9cf589abe4e3c41d07,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,18,005ee49efe581ef97df5d3c610c9ce352f95ab34396a00e27577a29f0cd7112d9e144681c65e567592582a3f0d01b3d33d2e184e7d4eaa57f97654966af5c70b,1569952243,1,1.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

Apart from that, all events will include speech of a representative of EXMO Exchange, which will tell how to quickly buy Decred using Russian Ruble, Ukrainian Hryvnia or Bitcoin, he will also give some technical and fundamental analysis of the Decred trading prospects 

The events will be moderated by our representative, Chief Editor of our channel, who will tell primary information about Decred

In the past year, you showed a lot of interest and dedication to our project.  Spreading the word about the project, developers, staking capabilities, new features, privacy, and more. You introduced Decred Project to EXMO Exchange that currently offers DCR to fiat pairs. I feel very comfortable working you guys. Smart, Positive, and Responsive.

Overall I love the idea of organizing events in major Easter European cities like Kiev, Moscow, and Saint Petersburg. Campaign details seem to cover everything necessary to host these events.

Possible Improvements: my only recommendation would be to get involved more with the community, developers, and stakeholders. You can learn a lot from people that work for this project, and they will get the opportunity to work with your team.  (matrix, Reddit, Slack, twitter)
You could be a great asset in Easter Europe and work for Decred as a contractor.

Below is the list of things I'm concerned about or see as potential roadblocks:

1. Four events to plan and organize. (a lot can go wrong with trying to host four events)
2. An upfront deposit of 70%. I don't think stakeholders will go for this.
3. Total budget: I think this area needs some work. Were you able to obtain quotes for spaces, to rent, traveling, etc. for all four cities? As a stakeholder, I'd like to have a bit more details.
4. How many people are you going to deploy for logistics, etc.?

Have you considered to organize a small local meetup in Kiev on your own and share the outcome with Decred Community? I think this can give you a lot of credibility and respect in the community. 

Is there a particular reason you'd like to do these four cities, instead of organizing an event in Kiev for example: see how it goes, and plan your next move accordingly?

Thank you guys.",4c7a867d09c57b2ff7a1a882cc3eb1aae0335f0e59fb30671645c31e4760ce4a2de3077e144ff3ff811243b79dd14c403038484e3ed78f545ee237d8cf53600f,5a452f52d8cf2f66a84689107273f3b3b292307877ba6d92d01bb2dfebeee236,4,7a3426ccadece79381151d5273455869df8d31b143ae24fca4f333a3eca8538b25b200f2370bbd270ea2c691ea6123288750f7337a86fe2da7cfe620c0c1ec0d,1568211595,6,6.0,False,88e2567c-dc60-45f8-953d-e13885ad9a73,dz_,

 1) We thought out the preparation plan well enough, and there will be 2 months between each event, which will make it possible to make a good promo and attract attention of a large number of people

In addition, we made an analysis and took into account that other large events do not take place at this time, which gives us confidence in the correctness of our plan

Each of the events will be a ""big happening""  for the local crypto community, and we hope that this will create a stir and people will add visit of these events to their calendar in cities we've chosen

In addition, we consulted with the EXMO team which cities to choose and where most of their users are located, which of course will give a good impulse to the growth of Decred trading


 2) We have already held similar events in these cities, so of course we have well calculated all the logistics, we have all the necessary contacts of local services (venue rental for the event, catering, banner manufacturers, etc.)

Our team, serving an event, consists of: two cameramen, live broadcast director, manager/administrator, host of the event = total of 5 people

In our experience, a 3-day stay in each city for an event is required

We always come to the location the day before the event, check sound and Internet, set the light correctly and have a discussion with the administration of the venue, stipulating all the details - this allows us to eliminate all problems during the event

Each of our events is designed for 100 people, the locations that we use can accommodate up to 300 people and if the number of pre-registered people is more than 100, then we can quickly increase the number of seats

The program of events and speaker's speeches are designed for 3 hours, with a coffee break

The venue is rented for 5 hours so that people can come in comfortably and without haste, register, leave their outerwear in the wardrobe (do not forget that it will be autumn and winter, when it is cold and snowing) and so they have time for networking in informal setting

Thus, the budget we are requesting in advance goes to rent and reservation of venues, catering, printing of large banners for photo zone, buying air tickets, booking hotels

Our experience suggests that if you book and buy everything in advance, it will save a lot of money than if we would make payments one or two weeks before the event

In addition, please note that all of our costs associated with the creation of video content, will be received after all of the events

 3) Our goal is to make Decred fast and efficiently enter the CIS market, which will make it possible to increase the number of Decred users in our region, and of course will increase the trading volume of Decred on EXMO

We plan to have 800-1,200 Russian-speaking Decred users after hosting all the events that install the wallets, will be added to the telegram chat and begin to build a community in our region

In each city, we plan to find a strong leader who will be inspired by the idea of ​​the Decred community and will help with its development, including hosting local meetups or participating in events organized by OKEx, Binance and EXMO exchanges in our region.

Trading of Decred on EXMO can be done with Russian ruble, Ukrainian hryvnia and Bitcoin, which is why, in order to give Decred popularity in the whole region at once and increase trading on EXMO for all pairs, we offer an integrated approach and a series of events",920919e7d1624bb899829157df201d032366c9398d348b40f2d1730c452842e48ed361d0d937e186186c1a23dfd669b8e7808452405e639a32db7c7f0f046b04,184280b7c662fa1a8291335f2329bb7e49c606ecd6cdc9f52b637ee6de5b2856,5,195e88edd95e9774c40cf890a3c11b1131373e327588a266558c59adfcd2fd3827b15400a79b7034588a21a6e33ace102f0003308e4e5a200a5ca458a821640f,1568230258,2,2.0,False,9a7a9b5d-4fa8-4b71-9556-e465eea3f692,bogdan_rud,

1. Have you provided this kind of service specifically for many other cryptoassets? Could you point to any exchange pairs where you are active? I think this is relevant for considering the difficulty of setting up and the likelihood that everything will go as planned.
2. I am interested in the ""open source order book transparency"" tools, do you have any examples of these tools in operation which you can point to? It seems like they would present public data from the exchanges. Would you also be willing to provide access to your account activity (through a read only API key, for example, as i2 have offered) so that your market making activity and the associated fees could be verified?
3. You are offering to perform a similar role to the other market maker proposals, but without the largest cost element (a fee for you to provide this service). This seems too good to be true, and the service you offer must be quite different if it can be provided without charging. Do you aim to make a profit from your market making activities?

* it seems that the reason Decred doesn't have liquidity or MMs is that the ""staking yield"" creates a bias against anyone leaving coins on exchange (i.e. I2 would rather stake their Decred then use it to create liquidity),

* if this hypothesis is true, then if we would offer a *standard incentive* of the staking yield forgone to any MM who agrees to leave coins on exchange, this would conceivably solve the problem, without granting a monopoly license that could be viewed as very ""unfair"" and contrary to our positioning as a ""fairer game""

If we go with a ""standard incentive"" model, as opposed to a bespoke incentive for one single firm, this would then empower multiple MM's to work and receive the incentive, ensuring strength within the ecosystem.

For example, this would make the Decred ecosystem slightly more friendly / attractive then other cc ecosystems, and it should bring multiple different MMs into our ecosystem, which would be great!  

To make this happen, here is a draft proposal that someone could post on Politeia:

**Incrementalist Proposal as a First Small Step to Solving Decred's Liqduity Problem **

**Problem: ** Decred has a liquidity problem, which we believe originates from the fact that everyone is staking to participate in governance and earn the staking yield.

**Solution: ** Collectively, the Decred community desires to solve this problem, and agrees to offer a ""standard incentive"" to any MM who holds their Decred on an exchange and performs a MM function at [x%] spread,

Process: 
* any MM can turn up and post their intention to perform the MM function with a public announcement on Reddit or Matrix (?-where is best),
* records of order book and trading must be maintained and Decred community has right to perform random spot checks on MM activities,
* in return for this valuable service, DCR Treasury will pay the staking yield + [y%] for coins tied up in MM activities,

Over the course of 1-2 years, we could tinker with the size of [y%], until we achieved our goal of liquidity and multiple MMs being active.  For example, we could start with y% = 0, to see if compensating for the staking yield would be sufficient.  

Personally, I believe that offering staking yield forgone should be enough, as earning the yield and maintaining liquidity would be a much better option than needing to have coins locked up to earn the yield. 

We would appoint a designated contractor for, say, [$2000] per month to review data from every MM on its trading operations, perform the spot checks, and ensure the staking yield is being properly paid out.

1. MM activities are not expected to turn a profit to support our team. We are well funded and have no desire to profit off MM activities directly. Our goal is to break even and in so doing, provide a needed service that will result in a larger, more mature Decred ecosystem where we may be able to offer other paid services to the community such as for-profit market making, asset management, otc, and cold storage. This will benefit us as well, as we are long time holders and stakers of Decred.

2. Correct. For all Decred pairs, our proposed actions will be purely for market making purposes. 

3. The exchange related risks, like hacks, volume spikes, trading losses, etc. must be taken to perform Market Making of any kind, so those are assumed risks for anyone trading on exchanges. The research done by our team has conceived a model that accounts for trading overhead, but we are also prepared to incur losses and we will bear them.

1. MM activities are not expected to turn a profit to support our team. We are well funded and have no desire to profit off MM activities directly. Our goal is to break even and in so doing, provide a needed service that will result in a larger, more mature Decred ecosystem where we may be able to offer other paid services to the community such as for-profit market making, asset management, otc, and cold storage. This will benefit us as well, as we are long time holders and stakers of Decred.

2. Correct. For all Decred pairs, our proposed actions will be purely for market making purposes. 

3. The exchange related risks, like hacks, volume spikes, trading losses, etc. must be taken to perform Market Making of any kind, so those are assumed risks for anyone trading on exchanges. The research done by our team has conceived a model that accounts for trading overhead, but we are also prepared to incur losses and we will bear them.

Trading DCR (one of the most illiquid assets) and making a market will require a very specific model and one that from my own experience and conversations with MMs over the last year has led me to believe it will result in material losses (hence the fees charged by others). How can Tantra project that you will not incur losses?

Although our system is optimized to minimize losses, we fully expect to incur them. Our proposal did not detail that we would not incur losses. We will bear them.

> In the event Tantra has miscalculated and gets run over quickly in their attempt to be a liquidity provider should you be engaged by the stakeholders, where does that leave us? Will you eat the losses or just abandon the effort and leave Decred back at square one with no MM and a process that has been derailed?

Our intention has always been to “eat the losses.” As longtime holders and stakers of Decred we have made a long term commitment to the community, and we view our market making proposal and intended market making activities as a continuance of that ongoing support.",972c115668abf9dc39b557974643082eb6a9780ccd82a1d914ff32780cced9911cecd3104d83d28a32aec29a60a1d21bed2d609e6ddb561559e3f93ba424ee0f,46282ad3959b0f5f492aa782dbac7112b9f48bdb4346e20100224f1a2c478f18,26,d9de0e9bd21018a9a8197bc224e261fc8ece1fd6e2344b8b456098dd0a113024d24ef0bc1876665e5a0426e8e8c6abd75d97e8dfb0038c3f8282c46e169a9004,1567229296,2,3.0,False,e9172423-e790-4da1-8616-0d43a5eee50f,tantralabs,1.0

These are very different markets to the DCR ones you would be operating on if selected.

I have a few questions aimed at clarifying the mechanics of the low/no fee model. Particularly, I want to understand more about the risks allocation and how the break-even point/profit motive plays out.

In short, risk carries a cost. I wish to understand how this risk is priced into this model (how is break even achieved and how is the risk taken compensated?)

1. Reviewing your provided slides, you have a reasonably sized team. Can you please clarify if/how MM activities are expected to turn a profit in order to support this team. 

2. Am I correct that your operations on exchanges will purely be market making and no actively taken trades will be occurring such that price discovery is organic and driven other market participants only?

3. I understand there is community support in terms of lending DCR liquidity. Recompense for staking rewards is fair. That said, there is clearly risk being taken by these lenders (exchange risk, hack risk, liquidity spikes, loss of funds etc). I am keen for some clarification as to how this risk is priced into the model.

At the same time it's nice and healthy to see competition in the MM space.

Idea: if Tantra doesn't win this RFP voting round because its lack of reputation, I would look at the vote counts. If there is any significant number of Yes votes for Tantra, I would consider a slower path: submit a 2nd small proposal to showcase your MM service in a demo scope for a few months. If that works out, next time the community might be less skeptical and could consider a full 3rd proposal for a role of a second MM that covers a different set of markets.

The market making code will not be open source for a number of reasons, primarily because we do not wish for bad actors to be able to take advantage of our proposed market making activities.

“Fixed loss” isn’t quite accurate as these proposals are not showing performance, and the minimum spread quoted by all market makers is generally still profitable after fees. A model tuned to purely provide liquidity would in theory have less risk and more potential upside from looser spreads. It all comes down to the spread of liquidity -  risk is directly correlated to the liquidity we are providing. For instance $20k across 1% is far more risky than $20k across 3%.

1) 
For the past two years we have been active on BitMEX, and more recently also on Deribit, trading XBTUSD, XBTU19, XBTZ19, BTC-USD, BTC-27SEP19, BTC-27DEC19, all as a liquidity provider. Our algorithms use limit orders only, no taking. Our platform is adaptable to any exchange, any trading pair, whether it be traditional finance or crypto.


2 ) 
Shortly after going live, we will release a dashboard where the Decred Community can view the historical effect of our market making by viewing the change in Bid/Ask spread overtime, for example. Additionally, we will add the other tools we use internally to backtest and optimize our order book spreads, such as the following: 
- Combined Order Book - https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD
- Bid/Ask Spread - https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/spread/7d/USD?c=e&f=m10&st=log&t=l
- Trading Volume - https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/30d?c=e&t=b

With regards to APIs, we are happy to grant access to a committee of trusted Decred contributors / developers. At this time we do not wish to open up the read-only access to the public to avoid bad actors who may take advantage of our liquidity strategy. 
 

3) 
During our research, we realized that it is possible to provide this service to the Community without charging a fee. By factoring in our overhead we can set spreads to compensate for our lack of fees. Since the forgone stake rewards and trade fees are being covered by the treasury, that allows us to shift into providing more liquidity and tighter spreads. 

We do not need to charge the Decred Community because our model allows us to fairly provide liquidity to the market. Our goal is not to profit but to break even. Our market making model will be tuned to break even. As believers/holders of DCR we benefit from providing liquidity.

4)
The founders of Block26 and Tantra Labs have been involved in Decred since right after the initial Airdrop. They have been accumulating and could not be more bullish on the future of DCR. When we read the other proposals, we were not satisfied with them. We were in fact taken by surprise when they were submitted. There had been no prior public discussion, and the RFP was only put forth after the fact. As community members ourselves, and given our experience with algorithmic trading, we decided that we could make a better offer, one that we ourselves would vote for. As a result, we have spent the last two weeks working tirelessly to research and ready our submission in time to be fairly considered alongside the others.",649732912f2e7bfd4519ec890c02a93525801e45efda65d6cfd8393c0af37eb3e6b5f563db1e9e32de90415f397ff613b52788a6ea1666f268ed968f724a0208,46282ad3959b0f5f492aa782dbac7112b9f48bdb4346e20100224f1a2c478f18,5,36ceb53ded4208ce79934f625324c66cb523c52290d1515bc89d11a25e545f150d934662d83d3a3dcaa51f5b1a6fd80a11c53413511a9034370f1bcdbc935802,1567045642,6,6.0,False,e9172423-e790-4da1-8616-0d43a5eee50f,tantralabs,

[Firstly i2 has made some claims in our ""proposals"" Matrix chat:](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$156709308713584nMSeS:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com)
>Tantra Labs has approached us for investment several times. When I requested a look under the hood at their tech I was told, ""sorry that is proprietary."" Most trading firms looking to raise capital will at the very least provide some detailed data and trading history if not offer to show their system working in a live setting. Now maybe that stance has changed, but that was the nature of our conversations. Secondly, while it's completely possible they weren't aware of the MM RFP, it is odd that once they found out they conveniently submitted their ""own proposal"" on the very day the competing proposals were submitted for voting. Its hard to not to assume that this was all done on purpose.

>Ultimately though, we want to support the project and see DCR grow. We are extremely vested in Decred and its community. I say these things not as a knock to our competitor so that we win. I say it as a stakeholder in DCR.

[The claim that the system is ""proprietary"" coupled with what Tantra describes as their experience:](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/82ce113827140caaaf8b5779ab30402d3ed39f1911fdd2e8fa64cf0dc9e09ecb/comments/5)

Our algorithms use limit orders only, no taking. Our platform is adaptable to any exchange, any trading pair, whether it be traditional finance or crypto.

For me, this raises some questions:

* The derivative products described above are some of the most liquid instruments in the space. Trading DCR (one of the most illiquid assets) and making a market will require a very specific model and one that from my own experience and conversations with MMs over the last year has led me to believe it will result in material losses (hence the fees charged by others). How can Tantra project that you will not incur losses?

* In the event Tantra has miscalculated and gets run over quickly in their attempt to be a liquidity provider should you be engaged by the stakeholders, where does that leave us? Will you eat the losses or just abandon the effort and leave Decred back at square one with no MM and a process that has been derailed?",bd9f81aa73f05856abc838a4e75718609a488b77e002296cb9b15a9f275931239ddb24c3f8b4aac329067ea82dd88786a838341ed8e5dd8251134edfded22c0e,db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8,7,7bc8b9d875aef8024fcffffac111ed0872b2a61394d6808830098b16711806273b3e6493cbfcf73f69fcec633f28249756c4a0aac67bade6c0d67015a3bc8308,1567101918,5,5.0,False,69934791-d575-44fc-9816-e7e58ff53726,jz_bz,

Could you clarify the number of pairs that you are proposing to cover please? The table has 7 pairs but elsewhere the proposal says ""we can provide liquidity with 5,000 DCR per pair, for a total of 30,000 DCR"", implying 6 pairs.

Do you have a confirmed lender for the inventory you would need? As I read the proposal, it seems that the source of your inventory would be different to the i2 and Grapefruit proposals. Would you be interested in operating in addition to a primary designated market maker, if one of the other two proposals wins the vote but your proposal also has strong support?

I don't know if that would be desirable, haven't thought it through, but perhaps you could cover some of the exchanges which the designated market maker is not active on.

I2 is invested, Tantra is invested, and all of the people here on Politeia evaluating the proposals have skin in the game as well.

Under these circumstances, I am genuinely hopeful that we can find a path to doing what is truly best for the project.

Surely, with this amazing brain trust, we can figure this out! 

If we ask ourselves honestly ""what is best for the project?"" to in order to define a set of Evaluation Criteria against which we can evaluate the proposals and/or assess best path forwards, perhaps some of the following points rise to the surface...

These are points that I've gathered from various comments above, jz, richard-red, checkmate, and my own arm's length role in reviewing the proposals over past 4 weeks:

**Proposed Evaluation Criteria**
* does the team's approach truly solve the problem and bring liquidity, volume, and instos to the project?
* does the approach make it possible to evaluate if the MM intervention is having the desired impact?
* is the approach sustainable?  or will the MM eventually get run over picking up nickels in front of steamrollers?
* is the MM running a zero-profit model as a community-service?  or do they plan to profit from the community?
* what is the cost per month, i.e. drag on the Treasury?
* does the path incentivize ongoing market competition?

...

Hmmm... even after writing out this list, I'm still left feeling dissatisfied.  My gut instinct is telling me it will be impossible to know if a given proposal will generate value for the community without actually seeing the results...

Like a couple of other comments here I would like to see:

2. A reporting plan with metrics on progress.  Ultimately the measures of success would be meeting your target spreads, and overall increases in exchange volumes (additional liquidity and less slippage should lead to higher volumes as traders find it easier to enter and exit the market).

Depending on how much more trading happens on exchange once the program begins, its possible that the trader would be able to comfortably execute this order entirely on exchange. I would however recommend that a trade of that size be executed OTC for the best overall experience.  Our desk is willing to inventory risk of that size, and therefore the trader would end up with a very good price and less market risk.  We have routinely done trades of this size, and our clients were happy with the outcome.

2) We will provide reports on the total Decred volume (not just our trading) in all the markets we are participating in. Over time, this should demonstrate the increase in DCR trading, which could be valuable to the community.

3) To respect the privacy of our clients, we are not allowed to disclose who we have traded with.

I believe that acceptance of any market maker proposal are illegal, unethical, a waste of money, and a potential project killer. Below I will list the reasons why the MM proposals are so concerning.

A) Acceptance of It is in violation of Rule 5250 FINRA received comments on Rule 5250 (Payments for Market Making) in response to Regulatory Notice 17-14, which requested comment on FINRA rules impacting capital formation.3 FINRA believes it would be useful to solicit further comment on the effectiveness and efficiency of Rule 5250 as part of the retrospective rule review process. Rule 5250 explicitly prohibits a member or associated person from accepting payment or other consideration, directly or indirectly, from an issuer or its affiliates and promoters, for publishing a quotation, acting as a market maker or submitting an application in connection therewith. The rule excepts: (1) payment for bona fide services, including, but not limited to, investment banking services (including underwriting compensation and fees); (2) reimbursement of any payment for registration imposed by the SEC or state regulatory authorities and for listing fees imposed by a self-regulatory organization; and (3) any payment expressly provided for under the rules of a national securities exchange that are effective after being filed with, or filed with and approved by, the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange Act. The prohibition on accepting payments for market making, originally articulated in a Notice to Members in 1975 and codified in 1997, is intended to assure that members act in an independent capacity when publishing a quotation or making a market in an issuer’s securities.4 FINRA has stated that such payments may be viewed as a conflict of interest since they may influence the member’s decision as to whether to quote or make a market in a security and, thereafter, the prices that the member would quote. FINRA seeks answers to the following questions with respect to this rule:

2) Unethical - A market maker providing services for a fee can be construed as market manipulation and a violation of the spirit of the law. Even if one does not believe Decred needs to follow FINRA, CBOE and SEC rules why would the Decred Treasury pay for market making when in the real world firms like Citadel and Viirtu actually pay for order flow. The is correct, Citadel and Virtu pay to receive order flow. If I2 provides such amazing service. Please provide a list of projects that you have provided market making services for. We look forward to seeing the list.

3) Waste of Money - Drain on the Treasury. This is the third and troubling aspect of paying for market makers as a service. It can be broken down into 2 parts.
First, there will likely be no real benefits of paying for market making as a service. Besides short term liquidity be a market maker provides no value and will come at a fee of $30,000 per month. Payment to stabilize a market can be viewed as market manipulation. Once again if I2 can provide a list of success and failures for their market making as a service that would be great. The community should know more about I2 and their service. We look forward to seeing a list. Secondly, why would I give a market market maker a free put / call to trade around? That is what that $40,000 a month is - it is a option for I2 to trade around their own book. If you would you don't understand that, you don't understand how markets work.

4) A Potential Project Killer-
As someone that has spoken with regulators and on several matters I can say. The regulators know a few things really well. First, they know trading. Second, they understand markets and market mechanics. A payment to a market maker might cause an inquiry for an investigation on if Decred is a security or not. Even if one does not believe Decred is a security, just an inquiry could derail the entire project. Kin, for example spent $5 million on legal fees in a short amount of time. What happens if Decred ends up spending $15 - $20 million on a prolonged investigation. Say goodbye to the Treasury. Will the all the coders work for free if there is no treasury left. The answer is no. Look at all the crypto projects that have fallen apart because there is no way to compensate the coders.

Secondly, this does not address the MM proposal directly, but the regulators are also watching the Atomic Swap market, as they believe it is a type of exchange activity and should be regulated. Don't believe me? Check out the Fintech Forum at the SEC on May 31, 2019. https://www.sec.gov/video/webcast-archive-player.shtml?document_id=053119fintechforum

I believe that acceptance of any MM proposal will provide little long term value and have a chance to kill the project. A killed project would not be a good SOV.",4bf98459777a5f166f8b78e55445a7d181e4d39bb1db3a8c5faaff0e83adedb135dbaea196bb5839a53d7a9ea624ea924b3d0c2a5f904d2914ec424a9bfa8e07,528b7aa72ff033016b3f284786d922aaf4841dd3e98787b1b075b542a67c6539,25,e17b5d490eeaf05e8e605c1ec9d8f43650fb6ddee01ffddec61964b0a6a0a615a48ff54fb6d752cb8e22860c95b53e8f7c3d3319c739e5b1fa9e065558e5b90b,1565353872,-1,4.0,False,4948fc87-b6b1-4514-846c-60209cfb7482,jango,5.0

1) Thank you for your message.  As a MSB and primary dealer we are able to make markets on all proof of work currencies as they have been deemed commodities not securities in the US.  The rules you refer to are for securities.  Moreover, there is no clear regulatory guidelines either way regarding market making cryptocurrencies.  I appreciate your concern and will voice your thoughts to our counsel to see if we are missing anything.

2) Order flow and market making are two separate things, so I don't fully understand the point you are trying to make here.  The only point I can address is that market making is not the same as market manipulation.

3) There are many prominent DCR stakeholders who have traded with us and continue to do so.  I would suggest you onboard with us and trade with us if you'd like to experience our OTC offering.  We cannot provide information to you about who we have traded with as that would be a breach of our MPA contract with our counterparties.

The SEC has written that two cryptocurrencies are not securities.  Bitcoin and Ethereum.  The SEC  has ruled that several crypto currencies are in fact securities. Being a POW or POS coin has not been been determined yet.   

2) The fact that you want to provide bids and offers where the are not legitimate is the definition of market manipulation.  

Market manipulation is a type of market abuse where there is a deliberate attempt to interfere with the FREE AND FAIR operation of the market and create artificial, false or misleading appearances with respect to the price of, or market for, a product, security, commodity or currency.

3) You are asking for compensation of want $30,000 - $40,000 a month. 
 Since you can't answer I guess that the answer is no one.  I have no problem with you being a market maker in Decred.  My issue is that you should not be compensated by Decred.  Citadel and Virtu make markets in thousands or stock, options and futures and they don't get paid by the company or the exchange.  Citadel and Vitru pay rebates for order flow.

4) 
Part A.  Overstock spend $107 million to defend itself from the SEC due to their T-Zero project.  Kin actually spend $5 million defending itself from the SEC.  There is a real chance that there will be an investigation on Decred if they pay for Market Makers as a Service.  

Part B is not hypothetical. The SEC firmly stated that they are watching the markets and watching exchanges and the participants. Don't believe me? Check out the Fintech Forum at the SEC on May 31, 2019.

I believe it is in the best interest of both the Decred community and the MM themselves that each MM provide **evidenced** commentary of their regulatory standing and how any arrangement would be compliant with regulations. Without such a response and confidence in the regulatory outcome, I will not be supporting any MM proposals.

The risk to reputation and Decred viability as an independent project cannot be overlooked and must be protected at all costs.

I agree that BTC has been classed a commodity however even ETH has not yet been officially recorded as such. Until DCR is also explicitly stated to be a non security, we cannot assume that it is not. Paying for MM services may be the final straw that triggers such a classification and must be researched and commented on in detail before progressing.",b090a3abbc2a834b64e41c6c5e2c142e660531bda0ef1c7cd54a1142e185612f768d940a221271c7076c2e7dd8899ee33db6dbfea0e7aebfe7b95d9c315b260b,ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323,38,856e9deb9140fcc318ce62180741308e2310fbc3fc585930d3984801148e980ff45a9eeb2424454b92c6bc50dbb7b472498360aa06e77e6ae1ba849d9962b407,1565436865,3,3.0,False,eb486ed6-bbb3-4815-9547-599cc0f28325,_checkmate_,

a) Regulatory legality and compliance
b) The Ethics of Decred paying for such liquidity.

I am not well versed in the legal/regulations however I will say that Decred MUST maintain it's independence and reputation at all costs. Any action which may be adversely perceived in the eyes of regulators must be avoided. Only BTC is classed as a commodity, I do not assume DCR is safe until explicitly stated as such.

As such, I request that the community and MM proposers research, comment and address potential risks associated with Decreds direct engagement of a MM.

**As an alternative idea** It may be desirable for Decred introduce a layer of separation from the direct hiring of MMs. Decred may be better placed employing a project manager team (on which we do due diligence) who are tasked with enhancing market infrastructure. The treasury funds this PM team who shall then exercise their expertise in regulation compliance, legal matters and market infrastructure.

Imagine you want to sell me your used car for $5k and I offer to pay you in DCR. If I pay you with DCR using the last print as the price and your immediately selling that DCR would result in you receiving $4.5k that would not be a great offer. Having a MM there to absorb your sell order very close to the last trade price significanly enhaces the user experience, and you get your $5k.

Likewise, if you were a contractor and had some DCR you needed to sell every month to pay your rent and expenses it wouldn't be great if you put in a market order and the price dropped 5%+.

What having greater depth on the oderbooks does is build market confidence as people can get in and out more easily. They are able to immediately mark their position to market and don't have to worry about ""nothing but air"" if they try and sell.
In essence the stakeholders are socializing the cost of a better market experience for all DCR users and traders.",e3e83db005d5d38029bcdd3b3ed808750f2f0f384e6063137606d3701063a72dcfd6ab63059f9cd2251a154976a8a387546844a09ae3700859e4c15bd4437c0a,db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8,4,35600a20ed4d1c6733c1c05476ba8596c4120255e965ee04103dd894ebd4349f422c69862eaa4d1b40571dda4fe1ec2b8a10426a64db84385be4278b40e81208,1565212617,4,4.0,False,69934791-d575-44fc-9816-e7e58ff53726,jz_bz,

Based on similar projects in the market, I feel it a relatively low probability that DCR would be classed as a security and therefore lower probability of such adverse conflicts of interest.

I still welcome anyone with more evidenced information or opinions to provide it for the wider education and information of the community. 

However at this stage, whilst a valid consideration, I now feel more confident that Decred's direct appointment of MMs does not carry a significant ethical or conflict of interest.

Put in perspective, it is ~10% of monthly Treasury income and 15-20% of monthly spending (as of May-July 2019). It spends more than the team building our novel DEX (and skilled developers is the biggest bottleneck in the space!). I want to be absolutely sure this money is doing a lot of good work.

Besides the spend I'm concerned if the market needs the proposed size of liquidity right now. If not, we will just burn money producing the service that is not fully consumed.

If liquidity is as big of a problem as we _assume_, then _any_ increase will be beneficial, i.e. even extra $10K on buy and sell sides will improve the situation.

In the interests of fairness, I have more or less the same comments and questions for each market maker proposal, but there are also a few which are specific to your proposal.

1. I appreciate that you have stated in another [comment](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b/comments/13) that you would pay for trading fees and these would not be charged to the Treasury. Is there a down side to this? Would you be taking any action to limit trading fees? Is the 80% uptime quoted relevant here?
1. Have you provided this kind of service specifically for many other cryptoassets? I think this is relevant for considering the difficulty of setting everything up and the likelihood that everything will go as planned.
1. I am interested in the degree to which market makers are paid to make markets for other cryptoassets - whether Decred is really unusual in not having any party that provides this kind of service.  Would you care to make some general statements about how common this is? I realize you may be constrained in what you can reveal. 
1. Can you match or better the i2 [offer](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$156527909310923oaewi:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com) of API key type read access for a Decred representative? Do you have any other suggestions about ways in which you could demonstrate that your obligations were fulfilled?
1. What happens if you don't hit the targets for uptime or depth?
1. Forgive me for being blunt, but $30k/month  seems like a lot to set up and run some trading algorithms with borrowed DCR. I recognize that some portion of this is to cover the risk of trading losses, but I don't have a good sense of how much you would be likely to lose in a month. As I understand it you would aim to break even, and tolerate a small loss. Are there ways in which you could incur a much larger loss than you anticipate? I'm not familiar with market making and would like to understand what the DCR would be paying for in more detail.
1. Is the DCR loan referenced the only loan you would require?
1. Lastly, the proposal is in my view incomplete without agreement from the lender about their terms. As jz has also suggested, I would prefer that the lending costs be incorporated within this proposal. I appreciate that you have proposed an interest rate for the lender and provided some calculations, but it would make things easier if each proposal represents a complete package.",ce4051454893cb27e306620d27135895d8cf53fac30d8629d99dceaedb7ef1a6af2937cf304dbd381741d3a3178b9d4b5c902ea93de1bf74f0935b34fb7aaa09,cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e,19,6fb7d1c7fa8307827914396fc05d12b1b310aa7a2cd0a5993da45939137cc2a5ed33b656405fd327462c7a0f5224e4bc48da6c6849a5cc312f7c248e59fc100e,1565297019,4,4.0,False,350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c,richard-red,

I believe that acceptance of any market maker proposal are illegal, unethical, a waste of money, and a potential project killer. Below I will list the reasons why the MM proposals are so concerning.

A) Acceptance of It is in violation of Rule 5250 FINRA received comments on Rule 5250 (Payments for Market Making) in response to Regulatory Notice 17-14, which requested comment on FINRA rules impacting capital formation.3 FINRA believes it would be useful to solicit further comment on the effectiveness and efficiency of Rule 5250 as part of the retrospective rule review process. Rule 5250 explicitly prohibits a member or associated person from accepting payment or other consideration, directly or indirectly, from an issuer or its affiliates and promoters, for publishing a quotation, acting as a market maker or submitting an application in connection therewith. The rule excepts: (1) payment for bona fide services, including, but not limited to, investment banking services (including underwriting compensation and fees); (2) reimbursement of any payment for registration imposed by the SEC or state regulatory authorities and for listing fees imposed by a self-regulatory organization; and (3) any payment expressly provided for under the rules of a national securities exchange that are effective after being filed with, or filed with and approved by, the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange Act. The prohibition on accepting payments for market making, originally articulated in a Notice to Members in 1975 and codified in 1997, is intended to assure that members act in an independent capacity when publishing a quotation or making a market in an issuer’s securities.4 FINRA has stated that such payments may be viewed as a conflict of interest since they may influence the member’s decision as to whether to quote or make a market in a security and, thereafter, the prices that the member would quote. FINRA seeks answers to the following questions with respect to this rule:

2) Unethical - A market maker providing services for a fee can be construed as market manipulation and a violation of the spirit of the law. Even if one does not believe Decred needs to follow FINRA, CBOE and SEC rules why would the Decred Treasury pay for market making when in the real world firms like Citadel and Viirtu actually pay for order flow. The is correct, Citadel and Virtu pay to receive order flow. If Grapefruit provides such amazing service. Please provide a list of projects that you have provided market making services for. We look forward to seeing the list.

3) Waste of Money - Drain on the Treasury. This is the third and troubling aspect of paying for market makers as a service. It can be broken down into 2 parts.
First, there will likely be no real benefits of paying for market making as a service. Besides short term liquidity be a market maker provides no value and will come at a fee of $30,000 per month. Payment to stabilize a market can be viewed as market manipulation. Once again if Grapefruit can provide a list of success and failures for their market making as a service that would be great. The community should know more about Grapefruit and their service. We look forward to seeing a list. Secondly, why would I give a market market maker a free put / call to trade around? That is what that $30,000 a month is - it is a option for Grapefruit to trade around their own book. If you would you don't understand that, you don't understand how markets work.

4) A Potential Project Killer-
As someone that has spoken with regulators and on several matters I can say. The regulators know a few things really well. First, they know trading. Second, they understand markets and market mechanics. A payment to a market maker might cause an inquiry for an investigation on if Decred is a security or not. Even if one does not believe Decred is a security, just an inquiry could derail the entire project. Kin, for example spent $5 million on legal fees in a short amount of time. What happens if Decred ends up spending $15 - $20 million on a prolonged investigation. Say goodbye to the Treasury. Will the all the coders work for free if there is no treasury left. The answer is no. Look at all the crypto projects that have fallen apart because there is no way to compensate the coders.

Secondly, this does not address the MM proposal directly, but the regulators are also watching the Atomic Swap market, as they believe it is a type of exchange activity and should be regulated. Don't believe me? Check out the Fintech Forum at the SEC on May 31, 2019. https://www.sec.gov/video/webcast-archive-player.shtml?document_id=053119fintechforum

I believe that acceptance of any MM proposal will provide little long term value and have a chance to kill the project.

""It was suggested that we approve the proposal with the largest Yes - No vote tally, as it should be the choice most voters are content with. Should proposal A have 70% approval and proposal B have 65% approval, proposal A would be approved and proposal B would not. If everyone understands this, they are free to vote Yes on as many proposals as they are happy with (vote Yes on all if they want a MM and don't care which one it is).

a) Regulatory legality and compliance
b) The Ethics of Decred paying for such liquidity.

I am not well versed in the legal/regulations however I will say that Decred MUST maintain it's independence and reputation at all costs. Any action which may be adversely perceived in the eyes of regulators must be avoided. Only BTC is classed as a commodity, I do not assume DCR is safe until explicitly stated as such.

As such, I request that the community and MM proposers research, comment and address potential risks associated with Decreds direct engagement of a MM.

At this point, I am not convinced that hiring a MM is a good idea. The purpose of hiring a MM is to increase the depth of buy and sell sides of order books for the benefit of people who want to quickly make large trades.

Not counting the loaned collateral, these proposals tend to have an average monthly cost of roughly **10% of the current treasury inflow**. If DCR prices were to dip back down to price levels seen earlier this year, that could quickly become **20% of the current treasury inflow**.

I do not believe that it is a wise use of treasury funds to spend 10%-20% of the entire treasury inflow on what is essentially subsidizing whales so that they don't have to pay a slippage premium for immediate fills.

Put in perspective, it is ~10% of monthly Treasury income and 15-20% of monthly spending (as of May-July 2019).

Great to see a second offer scaled down to $28K/month.

1) **Legal/Compliance/Regulatory** It is my understanding that these are smaller trading firms without built-out, experienced Legal and Compliance teams -- legal and compliance teams with experience in both traditional and crypto landscapes. Please notice none of the larger trading firms in crypto have submitted proposals. The largest market-makers are: Jump Trading (Chicago), Cumberland Mining - DRW subsidiary (Chicago), Genesis Trading (NYC), BlueFire (Chicago), Susquehanna (Philly). Imho, would be a completely different story if one of these firms was proposing. _Generally, I'll ask, do we really need this? Is this essential to Decred Project right now? Is it worth a potential lawsuit if there is a falling out between the DCR community and one of these trading firms?_
--> **Can we do AMAs with the Legal and Compliance officers at these trading firms to discuss an regulatory/compliance/legal issues?** Would also be good to do AMA with founders like Mike Komaransky. I know Komo was instrumental to early days at Cumberland and has a good reputation, but would be easier to get direct clarity if founders are willing speak directly to DCR community -- that way the community can ask hard questions.

2) **Market width is very wide and fee is very high** Fee doesn't make sense. There shouldn't be a fee. These firms have already written to all exchange APIs. _It'll take them 5minutes to start market-making with the DCR that we lend to them, and then they kick back and collect their fee monthly_. Imho, there should be no fee.

Understand that traditionally the theme has been to push forward with tech and let gov't entities catch up. But market-making on centralized exchanges alongside many assets (ERC20s) that will likely be deemed securities, is an area where the Decred community should tread lightly for now.

Secondly, if the community chooses to proceed without SEC clarity, it is a good idea to potentially set-up/incorporate an intermediary entity that is responsible for the lending of DCR from the treasury, payments/fees and moderating MM behavior/relationships. This entity would bear all legal and regulatory risk/liability associated with whatever strategic operations for which the borrowed DCR is used, aka market-making.",4f596b2e14fedf7b882b5f565dee4ba02e472138be7e773b3bd2331433ab0dd525f0f8a8925cc0ad638a64b645d6dc88c94543f14ea06a7d60d05ee4116d0002,d94e4e3478a69860eb90f27576cc51233e8cf04b590dd3d992e5961672694aec,39,fb785dff36c38ba46c9933d56b240c62cca4a9ceee620f97fc94e674af5eed1a9ba2f6d8f1f3f7fe0f1e1ca18159cc79d126364326b6749d8627887ad1f18209,1566932524,1,1.0,False,1e3e9a5e-5d2d-4881-9864-999270ce0cf2,decredphilospher,

i2 is bidding $30 - (1% of $30) = $27 and offering $30 + (1% of $30)  = $33. Their market will be $27 / $33

Grapefruit will be 2% wide meaning that our bid price - ask price will be $6. This could be $27 / $33 (same as i2), $30 / $36 or, $24 / $30.

We specifically chose to word our offering this way because this gives us the flexibility to adjust our pricing relative to mid based on our inventory while still maintaining the same spread.

1. While none of the current proposals would allow someone to enter/exit positions of greater than $1M USD in one click, it would still greatly help the situation. Generally when large players want to put on a position, they use advanced execution algorithms. Even in the most liquid of assets (think Apple stock), positions are not generally entered/exited in one fell swoop. The most basic of these are TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) and VWAP (Volume weighted average price). Most hedge funds have a team of PhDs working solely on reducing slippage. By increasing the liquidity available, these algorithms will be able to perform significantly better to reduce slippage form a target price which could be nough to sway a potential investor.

2.) I'm glad that you brought this up. One of the first things we made clear to the team was that we would not be able to guarantee any volume numbers unlike some of our Asian counterparts. We are based in the US and are a wholly owned subsidiary of a traditional finance firm. As such, we do not engage in wash trading or any activities that are frowned upon by the CFTC. We will only guarantee width/size/uptime. We're very experienced in market making in traditional markets which are generally much more difficult due to the increased efficiency of those markets. I'll elaborate more in the next point.

3.) Our firm is fairly young (1 yr old), so we've only done a this a few times under the Grapefruit name. We currently are market making for a few exchanges. We've previously supported the exchange launch of a new project as well. That said, in our previous stops, we've made markets across some of the most well known exchanges in crypto and traditional finance. Our founder (Mike Komaransky) was the founder of Cumberland and was one of the first market makers on BitMex and a handful of other exchanges before they were the household names that they are today. In former roles, we've also participated in structured market making programs in Euribor Swapnote Futures and Sugar futures on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (now part of ICE - owners of Bakkt) and Eurodollar Packs and Bundles on the CME. We've also provided liquidity in numerous Fixed Income and Equity derivatives markets in an unstructured manner during our high frequency trading roles.",f351ef869a2b9ca183b4adfab7c20a8da77bf8b235190ba9541926870470e1642c5bcae4950790de94320085f724b7c1bbc2b17b074d35df95b724cbca7eb101,4e745973d789988916efc0bedc426a5f253910ef37255fbe650a5bcfd39663fc,6,bed5fa5230947cdb814f8ed2e440e7e2387fdeb2fcdd98262c0b18c30ebf9d6f7e24d8a42bd878f868e86e45f0a4c2860e94a9a5747db6cc258a1af73d66f10c,1565271978,3,3.0,False,23c22d1b-134b-41f2-9c83-d9af6fb866a5,grapefruittrading,

In the interests of fairness, I have more or less the same comments and questions for each market maker proposal, but there are also a few which are specific to your proposal.

1. Could you estimate how much trading fees will cost per month or for the 6 month term? Could you put a cap on the amount the Treasury would be charged for?
1. Have you provided this kind of service specifically for many other cryptoassets? I think this is relevant for considering the difficulty of setting everything up and the likelihood that everything will go as planned.
1. I am interested in the degree to which market makers are paid to make markets for other cryptoassets - whether Decred is really unusual in not having any party that provides this kind of service.  Would you care to make some general statements about how common this is? I realize you may be constrained in what you can reveal. I notice on your website that the logos of Grin and I think Cardano are floating around, does that mean you have been engaged to provide this kind of service for GRIN and ADA markets?
1. Can you match or better the i2 [offer](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$156527909310923oaewi:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com) of API key type read access for a Decred representative? Do you have any other suggestions about ways in which you could demonstrate that your obligations were fulfilled?
1. You refer to the details of what would be provided as ""tentative metrics"" - what happens if you don't hit those targets?
1. Forgive me for being blunt, but $35k/month (including onboarding fee) seems like a lot to set up and run some trading algorithms with borrowed DCR. I recognize that some portion of this is to cover the risk of trading losses, but I don't have a good sense of how much you would be likely to lose in a month. As I understand it you would aim to break even, and tolerate a small loss. Are there ways in which you could incur a much larger loss than you anticipate? I'm not familiar with market making and would like to understand what the DCR would be paying for in more detail.
1. Lastly, the proposal is in my view incomplete without agreement from the lender about their terms.

For your first and third question, please look at my reply above, I briefly introduced some ideas of 'good' and 'bad' market making.

The second question is pretty interesting. The reason why people do wash trading is to attract more investors to pump the token price, and they can become billionaires overnight. It will greatly harm the communities especially those who truly believe the ideas for this project.

How to identify wash trading? The simplest way is to look at the daily or hourly volume. Altonomy is a liquidity provider, which will only post our orders to the market rather than take the order and make transaction. If nobody trade with us, we won't produce any volume. In this case, you will witness a stable and gradually growing volume rather than flooding.

Another method is to look at the trade history, if most trades happened within the market spread, which means best bid and best ask didn't cross, we can confidently say they are wash trades.

We can provide a healthy market, where you can make your transactions easily with better price (the best bid price will be as close as possible to the best ask price). The price movement will be more stable to reduce the investment loss of everybody. A good market maker can maintain a solid market like ballast stone. Without market makers, the market will be easily driven by good news or bad news, for emerging projects the price movement will be huge ( imagine the price goes up 100% or goes down 50% when you are asleep). 


We believe the potentials of Decred as we believed Beam and Grin a year ago, that is why we decide to work together with the whole community.",7b54f3fb6c9e7e555f31b281ddd7e509d3412a9f8638453ddbc4be1ff8aa80c562b044db0918ff79b25d703528423ed052215954543cd76a95dd341a5dc77d09,0d003e0b388cb8f86f98eafa56fa69a6c0f336c5037bc5b8c7f6ea8e4c08873b,12,8a768c987f2882b94bd18b03fb87ac5811164e3dd8b23ef401b1094755d2fa1b3d5e27da04cb1ee39601fb1fd3f5d8e0bb51d7f62a44318663cc7417646cd60d,1565297510,1,1.0,False,4ab8946b-6ba5-416f-818d-4239e0ee5b08,someone,

Yes you are right, market makers are meant to provide liquidity, but not only liquidity. Let me explain it in details.

Decred is at a very early stage, we agree with you, but we have already seen its potentials: DCR has already launched some of the largest exchanges, a pretty stable price, a growing community and a couple of millions daily volume.

However, we have seen a lot of examples of market manipulations, even for some very good projects. The price was controlled by a small group of people rather than the whole community, in the end most people lost faith in the project and nobody would get involve with it anymore. Extreme market movement will damage a project at its early stage.

We are not only providing liquidity, but also providing faith. Not matter how much DCR price has changed, we will always be there (as we signed the contract). We can be the last guy you can find in the market to trade with. We provide liquidity and provide our protect to stabilize the market and maintain a healthy and sustainable growth of Decred community.

Even though the service fee, as you mentioned, is expensive, we believe Decred deserve the best service, and we provided the world-class service to lots of teams at this price level. We believe Decred will be successful one day and we would like to help and contribute to this project.

Looking forward to your vote anyway, it will take some time to validate.",0607bf2806fa2badd3062f2b890849087cc74b85c494586ee001252c8d28f8c24720ccd754b1cc6b6433a3afcd12f715bda8b358470f34f9df3b4a604aa5c004,0d003e0b388cb8f86f98eafa56fa69a6c0f336c5037bc5b8c7f6ea8e4c08873b,14,5769d0bf5c88b179510ffa53c570814a42bd585854a2dec0406f795a2df93705d3379d92b9650f3999d657ff672ed7fe85e31f94a4b54f421e34996e98f4560b,1565301052,1,1.0,False,4ab8946b-6ba5-416f-818d-4239e0ee5b08,someone,

I believe that acceptance of any market maker proposal illegal, unethical, a waste of money, and a potential project killer. Below I will list the reasons why the MM proposals are so concerning. 

A) Acceptance of It is in violation of Rule 5250
FINRA received comments on Rule 5250 (Payments for Market Making) in response to Regulatory Notice 17-14, which requested comment on FINRA rules impacting capital formation.3 FINRA believes it would be useful to solicit further comment on the effectiveness and efficiency of Rule 5250 as part of the retrospective rule review process.
Rule 5250 explicitly prohibits a member or associated person from accepting payment or other consideration, directly or indirectly, from an issuer or its affiliates and promoters, for publishing a quotation, acting as a market maker or submitting an application in connection therewith. The rule excepts: (1) payment for bona fide services, including, but
not limited to, investment banking services (including underwriting compensation and fees); (2) reimbursement of any payment for registration imposed by the SEC or state regulatory authorities and for listing fees imposed by a self-regulatory organization; and
(3) any payment expressly provided for under the rules of a national securities exchange that are effective after being filed with, or filed with and approved by, the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange Act.
The prohibition on accepting payments for market making, originally articulated in a Notice to Members in 1975 and codified in 1997, is intended to assure that members act in an independent capacity when publishing a quotation or making a market in an issuer’s securities.4
FINRA has stated that such payments may be viewed as a conflict of interest since they may influence the member’s decision as to whether to quote or make a market in a security and, thereafter, the prices that the member would quote. FINRA seeks answers to the following questions with respect to this rule:
                 
2) Unethical - A market maker providing services for a fee can be construed as market manipulation and a violation of the spirit of the law. 
 Even if one does not believe Decred needs to follow FINRA, CBOE and SEC rules why would the Decred Treasury pay for market making when in the real world firms like Citadel and Viirtu actually pay for order flow.  The is correct, Citadel and Virtu pay to receive order flow.  If Grapefruit provides such amazing service.  Please provide a list of projects that you have provided market making services for. We look forward to seeing the list.

3) Waste of Money - Drain on the Treasury. This is the third and troubling aspect of paying for market makers as a service. It can be broken down into 2 parts.  
First, there will likely be no real benefits of paying for market making as a service.  Besides short term liquidity be a market maker provides no value and will come at a fee of $30,000 per month. Payment to stabilize a market can be viewed as market manipulation.  Once again if Grapefruit can provide a list of success and failures for their market making as a service that would be great.  The community should know more about Grapefruit and their service.  We look forward to seeing a list.
Secondly, why would I give a market market maker a free  put / call to trade around?  That is what that $30,000 a month is - it is a option for Grapefruit to trade around their own book.  If you would you don't understand that, you don't understand how markets work.  

4) A Potential Project Killer-  
    As someone that has spoken with regulators and on several matters I can say.  The regulators know a few things really well.  First, they know trading.  Second, they understand markets and market mechanics.  A payment to a market maker might cause an inquiry for an investigation on if Decred is a security or not.  Even if one does not believe Decred is a security, just an inquiry could derail the entire project.  Kin, for example spent $5 million on legal fees in a short amount of time.  What happens if Decred ends up spending $15 - $20 million on a prolonged investigation.  Say goodbye to the Treasury.  Will the all the coders work for free if there is no treasury left.  The answer is no.  Look at all the crypto projects that have fallen apart because there is no way to compensate the coders.  

Secondly, this does not address the MM proposal directly, but the regulators are also watching the Atomic Swap market, as they believe it is a type of exchange activity and should be regulated.  Don't believe me?  Check out the Fintech Forum at the SEC on May 31, 2019.

I believe no one will promise he will 100% making money using his market making strategies, otherwise he will become the richest person in the world. The most important metric for a market maker is about the spread, how close the spread you can provide, which stands for how much benefit you can bring to retailers. Idealy the best spread should be zero, because for a certain product its value is fixed, the buy price and sell price should be identical. This is the circumstance when no market maker can make money from the market. 
In this case I would say, in general, the closer spread we provide the less profit we gain. That is the reason why we put __spread__ as our No.1 metrics.
2. As I said, the simplest way to identify fake trades is to see if trades happened within the market spread. If so, we are comfortable to say it is a wash trade, because you didn't provide any liquidity to the retailers who really want to trade.
3. Based on my knowledge, I don't think market making will damage reputation of Decred to any extent. Let alone crypto market, MM is so common in the __equity market__, even Apple and Google have their market makers providing liquidity to their stakeholders. I don't think MM is a bad thing, on the contrary, it is a symbol of a sophisticated market.",72618cff62130b2492df9ccf216eb9cf54bbd0da60becb9dba22fd6ee842b45f3f9dc5c27cf0e0e9fa9e0d024e9640ba55164df8da4e502c58e9df6542e2060a,0d003e0b388cb8f86f98eafa56fa69a6c0f336c5037bc5b8c7f6ea8e4c08873b,18,5362665e5761d65aa020cee83864417cf1bf98f040dcbe6ab3b7a68621cc05145426b169cb3a6240434cdd9c31d5567df4e9185dc85012797994c8e0293b4308,1565375439,1,1.0,False,4ab8946b-6ba5-416f-818d-4239e0ee5b08,someone,

But like I said, we cannot provide a specific number at this stage because we do not know how our strategies will perform. I have received several comments like this one and we will for sure consider setting a upper limit for the trading fee reimbursement.
2. Yes we have provided MM service to tens of projects and exchanges.

6. I understand your concerns richard.   
Firstly I would like to clarify is that, setting up market making strategy is far from an easy task. Since DCR has been trading across various exchanges and we have to set different accounts and handle various exchange exceptions. There are tons of different exceptions you may encounter if you are familiar with these exhcanges. It is quite a burden for our team to have everything running smoothly 24/7, and that's why we charge onboarding fee.

a) Regulatory legality and compliance
b) The Ethics of Decred paying for such liquidity.

I am not well versed in the legal/regulations however I will say that Decred MUST maintain it's independence and reputation at all costs. Any action which may be adversely perceived in the eyes of regulators must be avoided. Only BTC is classed as a commodity, I do not assume DCR is safe until explicitly stated as such.

As such, I request that the community and MM proposers research, comment and address potential risks associated with Decreds direct engagement of a MM.

**As an alternative idea** It may be desirable for Decred introduce a layer of separation from the direct hiring of MMs. Decred may be better placed employing a project manager team (on which we do due diligence) who are tasked with enhancing market infrastructure. The treasury funds this PM team who shall then exercise their expertise in regulation compliance, legal matters and market infrastructure.

At this point, I am not convinced that hiring a MM is a good idea. The purpose of hiring a MM is to increase the depth of buy and sell sides of order books for the benefit of people who want to quickly make large trades.

Not counting the loaned collateral, these proposals tend to have an average monthly cost of roughly **10% of the current treasury inflow**. If DCR prices were to dip back down to price levels seen earlier this year, that could quickly become **20% of the current treasury inflow**.

I do not believe that it is a wise use of treasury funds to spend 10%-20% of the entire treasury inflow on what is essentially subsidizing whales so that they don't have to pay a slippage premium for immediate fills.

I do see the value for increased liquidity, but am not sure how paying large sums of money from the Treasury justifies essentially ""faking"" liquidity.

Yes, there is a chance this allows some larger buyers to step into the market, but there is no guarantee (or even likelihood) this will bring in heavy amounts of retail investors, nor contributors to the platform.

Decred is still at a very early stage, and I would like to see the market play itself out, and hang on to the Treasury funds these MM proposals are asking for for potential future needs.

Intuitively, we __can__ make profits with our market making strategies by buying low from one client and selling high to another client because our high frequency strategy can make decisions within milliseconds, much faster than normal people especially when market moves a lot.

However, the profit we gain is generated from the market, which means, we take profits from you, from the Decred community. The more profits we gain, the more money you guys lose. 

We're here to help Decred communities, to let more people involve and let those who got interested recently can get a chance to have their own DCR tokens and join the community. It's not fair for them to pay a higher price and lose money, that is why we decide to gain __$0 profit__ from the market.

We are able to set a goal to maximize our profits in the short term, but we do not think it is the best way in the longer term. So we choose to charge a certain amount of service fee and provide the best service we can provide to the whole community.

1.
The situation you described in your first question, is basically called ___orderbook depth___, which means how much DCR or USD you would like to trade in the market. Let's say if there're 100 people, each of them would like to buy 100 DCR at a price of $25, then in this case, you are promised to sell 10,000 DCR with a price higher than $25. However, if there're only 10 people would like to buy 100 DCR, you cannot get a price higher than $25 with the same amount of DCR. 

This is exactly the circumstance you described, if a person want to buy DCR with over 1M USD, it will be pretty hard to get a decent price (please look at table 1 in our proposal). You would see huge pumps and dumps in the market, which is not healthy for the whole community.

In order to improve it, we promise to provide better orderbook depth, to let people who interested in DCR are willing to do their investment. (please look at table 2 in our proposal). It will provide a more stable and reliable market with lower investment risk, and attract more investors.

---

2.
The 'ugly' you mentioned in the article is mainly about wash trading. What is wash trading? A market maker trades with itself, let's say, buy DCR with their own USD and then sell the same amount of DCR to USD. No clients will benefit from these fake tradings. This will generate fake volume and people will believe that the market is pretty hot and there're lots of active investors in the market, which is totally a fraud. 

As a 'good' market maker, we promise to only provide liquidity, that is, we only __passively post__ our orders to the market but we will never __actively take__ any orders from the market. 

---
3.
We are proud to have pretty wide connections in the cryptocurrency world, we are the top tier market maker among top tier exchanges, and some other second tier exchanges. Our strategies are able to provide liquidity over __10M__ a day, and can handle various circumstances 24/7 consistently.

Asides from exchanges, we have helped tens of clients for their ICO and market making program, some of them are the hottest project in recent months. 

It is our honor to grow up with those teams like Decred, and we are confident to provide better market for emerging projects. Good teams deserve the best service.

You can simply google us and learn more about us. We're happy to make more friends in crypto world. ^_^",57c3bf6e3418d0f704a88168c9089c6ddef8f4c641458b843d454ca87290cb34ba45f2eb88af95c27d9a48e68bae2422ba27437696f2bc4b714e08d9c31c6907,0d003e0b388cb8f86f98eafa56fa69a6c0f336c5037bc5b8c7f6ea8e4c08873b,8,0734055c1473b1e6e454c46d588ffa9f1bac8c73353eb9481ca8dadacc20c0922f4467448660dbcce2fd0d6f42bc57bc273937532528fe29274342d808f46a04,1565282688,2,2.0,False,4ab8946b-6ba5-416f-818d-4239e0ee5b08,someone,

I have one suggestion that instead of having the WebUI for client side in a good to have list, please include it in must have list, even if at extra cost. I think a WebUI will allow more people to initially test and later use DEX at relatively smaller cost.

One thing i wanted to ask was that afaiu client needs to remain connected for full duration until the order is fulfilled and there are penalties if orders are cancelled due to disconnection.

The scope of this proposal is a minimum viable product, which includes a CLI client, although a simple web UI may be a by-product of development.  **The real vision for the Decred DEX client is something very much like Decrediton --  a great GUI application written with the Electron framework for cross platform compatibility. ** Given successful completion of the work outlined in this proposal, the Electron GUI client will become a high priority.  It may even begin in parallel with the later stages of this work.

Great question about the requirement for consistent client connectivity.  As I mentioned in my response regarding Sparkswap, this will be a requirement so that users maintain complete sovereignty over their funds at all times.  However, depending on the state of the order and/or swap, there will be _short_ grace periods to allow the clients to restore their connections.  Still, I expect services to be designed to help with connectivity issues, which may be especially problematic for orders with long lifetimes.  I imagine trustless solutions for such services will be engineered, although I defer speculation to others with more expertise in advanced contract scripting and LN capabilities.  However, I see the use of a (securely-hosted) headless client and dedicated trading wallet as a fairly straightforward solution.  In fact, what I'd like to see is the ability to drive a headless DEX client process via the Electron-driven GUI much like how Decrediton may use a remote daemon.",5f13725f790e7d170798a950fc1101c98e095029e9dd5b485f9b76e63c21ed9cc969ef975394a7ffd09b49f648ba02ac9f0d301e0fd8cac728ae0ef793d2200f,22b54aa3030d05ebb4ab31c5c719b8fec9d979928ce517222fe80195e0d3596d,11,b32b5e149cbfc09736428c82983b96e281693852dec8346ea8fe27db23ee6c3478de30c02620e7f0742108deb7efa283ce0915be7ccabad274a61b258ff27e0d,1565547680,4,4.0,False,7f3a60e9-a8d1-4e43-a68a-94bb2409d75c,chappjc,

Some questions:

- Will email be optional to register and trade? More generally, will it be possible to register and trade without any third parties (email, phone, Google recaptcha, etc)?
- Will there be a public API for archivists and researchers to mirror a full local copy of historical order and trade data (like git clone)?
- If the above is yes, will the API also allow incremental sync of such data (like git fetch)?
- Will the client have features to mirror and inspect historical server order data?
- Will it be _possible_ for the researcher to detect if the server quietly removes (and no longer serves) select historical order data?
- Are client tools to detect server misbehavior in the scope of this proposal?
- Will the non-order data be public, e.g. ""Server X banned pubkey Y for reason 'bad behavior Z'""?
- Will the client have unrestricted access to the wallet like `politeiavoter` (give it the passphrase and it does all the job), or will it employ some method to not have the passphrase and instead ask the wallet to sign certain data (like in the protocol I suggested [here](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/720))?
- Why Electron framework and not something lighter like Qt or nucular or fyne as used in [godcr](https://github.com/raedahgroup/godcr)?

1. **Email** will not be used in any way.  Registration involves just submitting a public key and paying the registration fee.
2. **Public API for historical data.**  This was actually a fairly contentious issue in drafting the spec, but we settled on providing an HTTP API just for certain resources to prevent clients using polling to manage their trading.  Historical data would certainly be fair game for a public API, although it would not be suitable for a real time view of activity on the DEX -- that's what the websocket is for.  Regarding **incremental data retrieval**, that is a reasonable feature, which I can see being supported with URL query params (e.g. `?from=X&to=Y`)
3. **Historical order data inspection by the client** would initially amount to the standard charts and order book data you get from most exchanges.  Additional functionality could be added as the client evolves.
4. Regarding the possibility of a **server archiving or outright censoring historical data**, it will always be possible for a custom client or service to archive the orders as their are broadcast to all clients.  However, I do like the idea of hashing and timestamping order book history to prove an uninterrupted history.  Such client tools are not in scope for this proposal.
5. **Publication of non-order data** by the server such as account/pubkey bans, did not see a great deal of discussion in spec drafting, but I appreciate the need for showing proof of administrative actions for example.  Note that in a server mesh configuration, it would be necessary for such actions to be broadcast so that all the servers will be processing the same epoch and order book.  As such, third party archival of such actions similar to the previous issue of history archival would need to be supported, although development of such tools is not in scope for this proposal.
6. For the client to facilitate UTXO locking for order placement, and transaction signing for the swap process, the client will need full access to the wallet containing the funds to trade.  However, there has been discussion about account-wise wallet locking/unlocking that would help with security here.  There will need to be more research on this topic, but note that the wallet and client are both open source and running on your machine rather than a third party service.
7. As far as the **GUI framework** is concerned, consider that Go and other languages now target WebAssembly (thus providing interoperability via a JavaScript API).  Considering that Electron is essentially a JavaScript engine, this is potentially an efficient combination.  Regarding Qt, I personally don't wish Qt (or C++, TBH) development upon anyone these days.  I'm not as familiar with nucular or fyne, but I have found Electron based apps to be quite nice.  That said, I'm not the best person to be commenting on front end issues.",5ec374462ee3e58bd75af7569a2daf62df837727b305ba281bc8eccacd8b5b067bd66d84e19048273639673230bf8c2b4eaf8aa3ff7e3bb0e1685a62915a5707,22b54aa3030d05ebb4ab31c5c719b8fec9d979928ce517222fe80195e0d3596d,16,765a6119a58331b27516363ea93b8e77d6ed4a5a19466bd382f35ff5ea8d7a62065978448875878c6bb7f7c62e11e98514dbd935008e47d7d08505acd2c23508,1566248700,0,,False,7f3a60e9-a8d1-4e43-a68a-94bb2409d75c,chappjc,

Sparkswap has a dedicated wallet that must be funded for each asset.  Any wallet that you fully control may be used with dcrdex.

With Sparkswap, atomic swaps are done on the Lighting Network (LN), not the assets' blockchains. The initial implementation of the dcrdex will involve atomic swaps on the mainnet blockchain of each asset, but that need not be the case in the future.

To place orders with Sparkswap, funds must be ""committed"", which is done by opening LN channel.  With dcrdex, users merely identify UTXOs with sufficient value to fund the swap(s) that would be needed to fully fill and order, and sign the order with their account private key.

**The Sparkswap ""Relayer"" is analogous to the Decred DEX server process.  It is operated by Sparkswap (the company), while the dcrdex may be run by anyone.  The Relayer does not appear to be open source, except for the Relayer's gRPC proto definition for clients.**  Perhaps I have just been unable to locate the Relayer source.  Please correct me if this is incorrect.

The Sparkswap ""Broker"" is the client, and may be run by the user, but a Broker seems to be able to serve multiple users. A Broker can accept many types of orders, including market orders, but the Broker turns them into one of two specific types of limit orders: new limit orders for the book, and fills/taking orders.

**The Sparkswap Relayer does NOT perform order matching; the Brokers do this.  As such, there are no guarantees that users' orders are matched fairly.**  The dcrdex server has an independently verifiable epoch based pseudo-random order matching to ensure fair trading and combat a number of abuses and gaming of or by the exchange.  It is not clear to me how Sparkswap addresses order races coming from different Brokers.

Also like the Decred DEX, makers and takers are required to remain connected otherwise their orders will be cancelled.

The Sparkswap ""Relayer"" charges a 0.1% fee for placed orders and filled orders (0% during their beta period). The mechanics of capturing the fee is unclear to me.  dcrdex has no trade fees.

On Sparkswap, ""Trading Deposits"" for each order are used to disincentivize abuse, while dcrdex will use registration fee. Each order has a 0.1% deposit.  dcrdex requires no deposit for each order.

Front-running seems to be mitigated in Sparkswap by only allowing limit orders on the Relay (market orders only exist conceptually on the Broker).  This leaves much to the Brokers who may operate in any way they like.

Sparkswap on spoofing: ""Spoofing by sending orders and cancelling quickly before someone takes the order is still possible -- this is common on all mature exchanges, and extremely difficult to enforce any prohibition against without harming overall efficiency of price discovery.""  Although, spoofing by failing to execute an order that is filled is disincentivized on Swarkswap by the loss of the order deposit.  The Decred DEX penalizes frequent cancels following a cancellation metric, and similarly penalizes failure to perform the swap with loss of registration fee.

""Painting the tape"", or colluding parties creating a false appearance of a certain price, is disincentivized on Sparkswap with trade fees.  On dcrdex, epoch based pseudo-random order matching makes this risky to attempt.

**Order suppression by the Sparkswap Relayer is not prevented.** The dcrdex requires that orders be broadcast to all clients, and eventually to all servers once server mesh operation is implemented.",0f040c8aeff69ec5a8a5e4e8b01908aa0a0805169cad2f41b01d2b333694128e0b6bbb53c551dbd07986ae8531e42a8099badbd6cc6a300b1b90a00f76c7cb08,22b54aa3030d05ebb4ab31c5c719b8fec9d979928ce517222fe80195e0d3596d,4,f40b10c001ac4defb19f78e237ed1d7ffd35a59305a21a92f04501a43909edead4ef13977f022e3b7db76ba88d9ecd52418b890dd9f567552e848c7b6cf09e05,1565213149,9,9.0,False,7f3a60e9-a8d1-4e43-a68a-94bb2409d75c,chappjc,

Once the onchain DEX is online and we have a decentralized mechanism for price discovery, this could be fed into the routing decisions of LN nodes in a multi-coin LN, allowing transparent cross-coin payments.

One hypothetical way to realize this would be to have channels marked as cross-chain with a swap fee expressed as a % from the average price of the last DEX epoch and nodes use this information for routing decisions based on the max fee for a given payment.",da9ffacb6f8958b3c4eb36d5cecf0d498ed642b22ff567063eb7e2bb24cd84fe7852287dafc963e5b9341c3338577841de70e1031078dda33d241b3cde2b7907,6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686,5,a706c7f1ab12a7d1aff302f943efd526061e5a2161fa611c3d129601aa2e43640c4133881d94aad4b23df0b0eb28b0acb9dd5fa5092149e890cb07ab1417ec0b,1565268828,5,5.0,False,a287e4dc-9ba1-4eee-ab1f-9dcbf90c2f82,matheusd,

If we are doing to design it as an experiment, it seems excessive to go straight to six crosses, and foolish not to design in some controls.

For example, if we use a MM on both of the key crosses (USDT, BTC) that have all of the traditional liquidity on a given exchange, we won't be able to differentiate if an increase in volume on a given exchange is a general rise in volume that happens by coincidence during the experiment, or, as a result of the specific MM intervention.

If we do in fact want to run this as an experiment, then we need the best possible ""experimental design"".  

From the standpoint of ""experimental design"" there are many limitations, issues, and constraints with our setup.

That being said, assuming we can use ""trading volume"" as our dependent variable, then here is a simple case-based experimental design with 8 crosses evaluated in the data set, 4 crosses as controls, and 4 crosses as experimental, and creating max possible cross-case replication logic,

Experimental Setup:  run the experiment on four exchanges:
     - for the first two exchanges, introduce a MM on the BTC:DCR cross but not on the USTD:DCR cross (control) 
     - for the third and fourth exchange, introduce a MM on the USTD:DCR cross but not on the BTC:DCR cross (control) 

The replication logic in this design will allow us to answer the following research questions:

RQ-A:  does adding a MM produce the intended result and increase the BTC:DCR average daily trading volume for the two exchanges where the intervention was made compared against the two exchanges where no intervention was made?  

RQ-B:  does adding a MM produce the intended result and increase the USDT:DCR average daily trading volume for the two exchanges where the intervention was made compared against the two exchanges where no intervention was made?

RQ-C:  do all four MM interventions, regardless of whether the intervention was done with a USTD or BTC cross, consistently produce the same result against the control cross volumes?

RQ-D: if the intervention does produce the expected result, what is the %  increase in volume that we observe on each exchange relative to the control volume on each exchange? 

There are also other useful ""within exchange"" and ""cross exchange"" data that can be gathered with this experimental design.

By running this as an actual experiment, we can be significantly more confident in our conclusions at the end.  

My fear with the current proposals is that we would get to the end and our confidence in drawing conclusions might be quite weak.

Also, by approaching it this way, we can keep the costs down to four crosses, which should be ~ 2/3s the cost quoted for six crosses.

Not counting the loaned collateral, these proposals tend to have an average monthly cost of roughly **10% of the current treasury inflow**. If DCR prices were to dip back down to price levels seen earlier this year, that could quickly become **20% of the current treasury inflow**.

I do not believe that it is a wise use of treasury funds to spend 10%-20% of the entire treasury inflow on what is essentially subsidizing whales so that they don't have to pay a slippage premium for immediate fills.

+++

I've been watching this discussion unfold for a few days, and I believe the problem with all three proposals is as follows:

- people are saying ""it is an experiment"", but the proposals are not set-up with the scope, timeline, or cost structure of an experiment

- the term of 6 moths is approx. twice as long as is necessary to show what the results will look like

- the scope of 6 crosses is is twice as many trading pairs as is needed to observe the impact

- the cost of setup fees + $40k per month is definitely not anywhere close to the zone of an experiment

Why not 3 crosses for 3 months?  And priced at $12k per month, which would cover 2x half-time personnel?

The capital for running the MM function isn't even being provided by the MM (it is being loaned by a miner and paid for by the Treasury), so the MM doesn't have a cost of tying up capital.  I don't see what other expense they are bearing other than time and materials?

Why can't MMs come to the table with the same 'fight club' mentality that characterizes the rest of the Decred contractor community and prove they can add value before asking for professional comp levels?

Personally, I think this current batch of proposals should all be voted down, and the MMs should sharpen their pencils and come back to the table with  proposals with a scope and timeline designed to actually serve as an ""experiment"" and with pricing that basically reflects an attitude of ""please give us a chance to cover our costs and prove ourselves.""",1cedad9ef022bb37e3f972e31795851db6010a4a069010676bb51b343415d2b6444f63887d7d7fbfb7cfd4e617ee456600fc2e977072392334150e2c2e21f707,dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079,19,0137837f4bb2abd4afea62a2ac323d1ff66d3f3db4cddef08a28ae708a429f9eaef02701e509fd3fb8e905a44913aed0f97b9510c9ae6ea853015739a3704d0a,1565497205,8,10.0,False,0b4b0bb2-e406-40e2-9d08-8b6711fefb18,betterfuture,2.0

If avg. daily trading volume doesn't rise w/ the buy and sell walls showing up, then we can conclude that the real problem is a lack of interest to participate in the market, and not the lack of order book liquidity.

If there is no interest to participate in the market, they paying a MM to setup buy and sell walls to increase order book liquidity is a wasted expense.

+++

My hypothesis as to Decred's lack of liquify and volume is as follows:
   - the core community is very strong, like a cult, and they are all staking, but it is a cult that is operationally incompetent, and can't figure out how to market itself
   - since the general market hasn't really heard about the project the participation rate from typical run of the mill traders and speculators is abysmal 
   - Decrd's market awareness scores 1 out of 10 versus Bitcion's 10 out of 10;  see:  https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=decred,litecoin,bitcoin%20cash

Anyways, running a MM experiment should help us to understand better which of the two problems we have (a) lack of order book liquidity, or (b) general lack of awareness about the project.  If we run the MM experiment and average daily trading volume rises, we can conclude we have problem (a) and the MM proposal fixes it.  If we run the MM experiment and avg. daily trading vol stays static, then we can conclude we have problem (b) and we need to focus funding efforts on broad market awareness.

**Summary:  Setting up walls won't resolve anything if really the problem is that few traders want to trade due to a lack of market awareness about the project outside of the tight-knit core community.""",b8cc85979be21dfa5762e8c24e5215714ef7713863e25fb23ffb955244729bf59788934282e5c20c69534ef4b64bad0864aa8ee23d721054aaaec4a181b94f09,dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079,20,8ba954b1218ef3b75e39f2bcfb1909ee37c5f226d23af4fb88ebf68e3189949b0b4fec904ef5455b45c93e35f4e220b91f01a66dd591f6d76d128b50df76e20c,1565499619,2,3.0,False,0b4b0bb2-e406-40e2-9d08-8b6711fefb18,betterfuture,1.0

Decred either **IS** or **ISN'T** a security. A paid market maker service will not make it tip one way or the other.

If you believe Decred is a security, no current exchange should have listed it or should trade it. The implications would be major and we should all rethink our participation in this project and the implications of doing so. 

If Decred isn't a security the regulation you refer to doesn't apply at all and you are suggesting to vote no based on unrelated information.

Nobody is currently in position to say definitively if Decred is or isn't a security  because current regulation is incomplete and purposely vague regarding CC. What we can do however is use the SEC framework, past comments and existing laws regarding traditional security assets and  apply it to Decred to make an educated Guess.

My personal conclusion in this regard is that Decred is most probably not a security  (or at least, that hundreds of projects are quite a lot more at risk of being securities well before we even begin to consider Decred to be a security) I believe that major definitions of what are securities would need to be changed before that happens.  Thus personally, I will act and consider Decred not a security, unless an official regulatory statement is made and say it explicitly is.

Poloniex geofencing Decred,  while adding,trading and promoting an ICO at the same time should be enough convince anyone that their action have nothing to do with fear of regulations. Just like you should not make your decision based on coinbase's decision to consider Decred for listing either.",51937fde84400fbff6f2a6466f18dd38e79bf131d7ad6aab014b5da9aad882f689361ab63e2e98a5fa20678c2f33e24ee2e90ada5094a9ec605e6a50909b050e,0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9,21,67741275354aaf2dd6131c1039841b07f49d56ac067f26e93533fb231b9a0ce617ce3e6c3dfa030d7fca3e2ea1aefb266ad4b87c7da2094763cbccfe09b4890f,1565532255,9,9.0,False,3ffa2992-ace9-4a7d-abce-51872469e765,nnnko56,

These are all suggestions, not demands, please show your support or disapproval via comment votes and replies if you (dis)agree with a specific point.Feel free to extend this list in replies to this comment:

- **Cost** - It must be similar to other heads of expenditures, which from cursory research seem to be around $20-30k/month or lower.
- **Transparency** - One of the contributors (jz being a good candidate) should have at least view only access to trading operations of MM. Also whatever proof that would be provided if a regulator or court asked to prove no unethical practices are happening should be available to the community as well, in form of monthly reports(?).
- **Opt-out clause** - It should be possible to terminate the contract if desired results are not visible in 3 months with review happening every 3 months.
- **DEX** - Option to add DEX pairs when it launches.

My main motivation to consider a MM at this moment in time is to get research data and finding out with some degree of certainty that introducing liquidity on order books leads to better market interest. Other than that my suggestions are an attempt to reduce strain on treasury and achieve transparency/accountability and reduce need for trust.",6947bd514c921d70d094886d9075f008d91c6a1d8ae8cf7d5ed33e1078f1f4da0dad3dcc0172682374a600975ffa311cf89bcc33bbabcfd59aa6567a2a25810d,98cf480835aabf91c43c2913db1849d0c80b947f1fe1392804150a633582a84f,24,b559b818a8ca979b704737679b3b9541f5fe715a077f133f57ab5b2a5b1beb6d42160bb640cd29ba7bb0747e21c90482defc730dd66c5fd452932745557c2007,1565541837,4,5.0,False,ea2f8305-cd17-48ef-9620-955f6f4de887,sambiohazard,1.0

Decred needs some sort of an engine to kick-start trading of an asset that has a massive hodling properties. Great problem to have tbh) But I understand the market and its a very mean place! In reality when an asset has a great value roughly 10%(possibly even less) of all circulation that is on the exchanges defines the price. So when a majority 90% is hodling for the long term the minority which are day traders and speculators define/discover the price short/middle term. Exposing themselves to a much greater risks when in short term or swing positions. Im 100% in favor of MM coming to generate day trading.

-Im on a fence from ethical POV. Lack of clarity on mechanics of how MMs work with order book and inventory stops me from making a confident and well informed choice.

1- There seems to be some concern over whether or not Decred is a security. I tend to go off of the decentralization requirement those was used with Eth, it is decentralized enough to not be a security. I have very little to no concern Decred will ever be labeled a security. 

2- DCR has no liquidity. None. I can’t even sell 10 DCR at times without moving the stinking market a little. In order to attract more attention to Decred then we must have liquidity. Will you provide it by placing your DCR, BTC, USD up on the order books? I will not.

3- Concerns of wash trading and manipulation. I think it is possible to detect if these activities are taking place. I would like to see a clause added that would end the contract if detected.

My bottom line is that market makers are needed for Decred to advance where we all know it should be. I will be voting accordingly and giving my support for the MM proposal to IterativeCap. Vote for what you feel is in YOUR best interest.

I am not happy i had to spend any Decred to make this comment. What can i say, I love my DCR. But there will come a time when everyone wants to exit or increase their position. As the market stands now, its not possible unless you OTC. For people like me, with not nearly enough Decred to use OTC trading, a MM would be a tremendous help.

The discourse so far has been extremely healthy and both sides bring valid points to the table. My comments will hopefully illuminate why we thought it was prudent to work with an MM as well as clarify some of the misconceptions that are being brought up.

The need for an MM quickly arose as I began speaking with a number of institutional investors here in Silicon Valley. While Decred isn’t yet a household name, most researchers who spent time looking into the project were quite intrigued and were quickly interested in becoming stakeholders. Time and time again, I heard issues around DCR’s liquidity. The inability to acquire a large position wasn’t the main deterrent, but rather the inability to get out of a position once acquired as well as what illiquidity said about market sentiment. Investors know many times markets are forced to contract, and when they do, the most illiquid assets behave poorly. Not because of fundamentals, but purely because the market can’t absorb the selling pressure. Similarly, investors have to weigh current liquidity in their research as a measure of sentiment and demand. 

This doesn’t necessarily mean that MMs are being brought in to help the wealthy, it is merely institutions who have been most vocal about the problem. The lack of liquidity affects investors big and small, and it seems like contracts are the most affected as they actually have to liquidate DCR to pay their bills. Not having liquidity + constant sell pressure from contractors and miners forces the price down and does not instill confidence within the broader market. 

Another driving factor in our pursuit was the fact that an asset positioned to capture the SoV market needs liquidity. If an asset isn’t investable, I.e. liquid enough for investors to move in/out of, it can’t compete with other SoV contenders in the market. If you look back at Chris Burniske’s work on the institutional investors case for BTC, he notes that inevitability is one of the hall marks of any asset, and as such, we must prioritize DCR’s liquidity if we expect it to be an SoV. This issue is particularly exacerbated by the fact the DCR has such a high stake rate. 

In terms of cost, something that should be stressed is that everything is malleable. Costs aren’t fixed, and we prompted the MMs to create proposals that were flexible so that stakeholders could decide the appropriate number of crosses, market depth, uptime, etc. $30,000 within 2% on each side seemed enough to facilitate retail investors moving in/out of positions with ease, but my understanding is that the MMs are willing to make this number $50k or even $15k, it all really depends on what we think is best. 

Lastly, and we’ve stated this before, but all of the firms chosen to submit proposals are high quality firms with a lot of reputational skin in the game. For context, Altonomy just raised a large financing round from Polychain Capital, Grapefruit Trading was started by the former founder of Cumberland, and i2 has been a crypto OTC desk for a long time and active DCR stakeholder. We only engaged firms who’s values line up with those shared by DCR stakeholders.",5ad5f79ad19aaaf06f72b8725c9822c3ef3d2a5151f1fb046ac6ac6f33869b52f37b77b3d03052b75beb633c62c7522f37579642c4f88079c1029c706fdbd00a,107a5db445996608df8bd7cecfb6b3e41d74fd6c659916becb4e54167849a96e,29,6bc98d749769293faedb6c805eb521cf8a1816e1309e35271c025b523621d0e28b6a82bddc736a311b38361df14d3abf2d1ff0de26b712398db2807b2a841609,1565646704,10,11.0,False,ea4c8260-5c39-4421-afef-607d358125e5,maxbronstein,1.0

I believe I am for the idea of a paid MM now, as I have been doing some thinking on how Decred's PoS element drives the need for non-standard liquidity. In BTC or XMR, for example, the only cost's associated with keeping funds locked up in orders is the potential for losing funds due to exchange issues, but in DCR, you also give up potential earnings on PoS rewards.

The other main portion of your sovereignty lost when locking up DCR in orders on-exchange is the ability to vote and have a say in the future of Decred as a whole.

Because of these two reasons, owners of DCR are incentivized _not_ to provide any liquidity, as it ultimately costs them much more than on standard PoW chains. As such, I believe paying a MM a small portion of the treasury income is a great middle ground, and an excellent way to keep all of the benefits of staking DCR, while also being able to increase liquidity of DCR across the board.

The key here to me is that we, as stakeholders of Decred, can guide the MM process all the way through, and ultimately shut it down if it fails and or turns out to be unnecessary.

Tl;dr -- Because of PoS drastically reducing liquidity and increasing costs associated with keeping DCR locked up in orders on-exchange, a paid MM is a great thing to explore.",a85e41b64cc05b75ceeafe89c194ce1bb0fb764118deefbb367579dbae22b1fbdae04b160faca8b2b876a10c6ac301922eb19bcf206eff10ae75d3c1e523480f,18f6cb98e06dfd5153ccafc105e7b6ab812bcd1ac71b62829060cf49670ea791,34,e5bf371b62ba8b7ced02085bdd57f5c1d19c49b082290482484afc9aba655c13c87b1fd56128d2c48ae180639186efdbdefcbdd4eb9ba3ecd9f2ebe3b368c90b,1565701918,8,8.0,False,a1ff6940-7a62-40cb-ae2a-6dcd3bb1ddf7,fort3hlulz,

Until that time here is some related reading: http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/country/illiquidity.pdf 

I generally believe that creating liquidity at various pricing levels will attract traders to the asset -> who create additional organic liquidity (and volume). With the increased liquidity and volumes, the asset will become available to a new class of investors, particularly institutional investors with strict liquidity requirements in their holdings. Where today, even if these investors had an interest in Decred, would be barred or limited in the size of holding due to the lack of liquidity available today.

This is probably a temporary problem as incentives shift with lower inflation and hobbyist stakers go back to trading. also if and when this prolonged bear market goes away and regulatory uncertainty reduces, more people would be willing to trade.

IMO cryptocurrencies should not hire DMMs. Market makers must remain neutral from what they market make and ONLY crypto exchanges should bring them on the market or they market make themselves for profit.

It pointed out this risk factor you mention in terms of Decred falling under securities regulation if it participates in creating a market/supporting a market for Decred. My article agrees with your fears and validates your argument, there is a risk here. 
But in my opinion the risk is worth taking for multiple reasons. The first is that the SEC is currently going after much bigger and easier fish then Decred (KIN). They do not have the resources or manpower to go after every project that may or may not be a security. Secondly, they are focusing on ICO tokens for the most part. Third, because of how the Decred project is implementing this MM, by this very RFP, and by through seeking stakeholder consent first with politeia, we have a much stronger defensible position in case of regulatory intervention. If this decision were unilaterally implemented by the directors of the Decred holdings group, we would have issues. But that is not the case here. Fourth, the SEC is one regulator of one country. Decred is a worldwide project. Fifth, even if we do receive a penalty from the SEC against the Decred treasury, we could potentially vote on whether to pay or not (that be a strange proposal). Furthermore, we may be able to decentralize the treasury funds control away from Decred Holdings Group LLC before they are able to compel that entity to pay a penalty. However, this could mean the directors of the LLC could still be on the hook in the worst case. But in the best-case scenario, we could point to the now decentralized treasury as proof that Decred is no longer a security (Ethereum did something similar).

1) I do not see what recourse decred stakeholders have if the MM behaves in an unethical manner. Obviously stakeholders can create a proposal to break the contract but that has repercussions. This topic needs to be better explained in my opinion.

2) It has a potential cost of 7.2-3.6 million dollars a year. That is some serious cash. At this point would it not be cheaper to add 2-3% to the amount of decred the contractors are due? I understand that this also has to do with decred as a medium of exchange. But at this stage decred is rarely used as a MoE. Does paying a MM millions of dollars annually actually improve this problem?

1. RFP being done after the fact despite it being discussed prior to MM proposals showing up.
2. RFP voting start date was revealed even before proposal was up on Pi. I saw 100s of tickets being bought 2 days before voting started on this proposals. I can't say and am not saying that there was some kind of internal fixing, but knowledge of voting start date certainly allowed someone to stock up on tickets. This has been intentionally avoided other than admins knowing when vote will start. This ""looks"" bad imo.
3. Proposal was not updated with proposed amendments suggested in comments and my comment and some others were even left unaddressed despite getting some upvotes.
4. There is continuous talk of how opposition is only a vocal minority, which very well might be true in terms of voting, but i think valid concerns and reasonable amendments should be acknowledged and included regardless. It could be a unorganized majority of many which we need to encourage to join the discussion. This is necessary for decentralization.

In summary whole process looked very rushed, hap hazard and somewhat heavy handed. After 1.5 years of behind the scene work, why is there need to complete this in only 4 days of wider discussion. I wonder if this is going to be bulldozed through because majority supports it or they have the votes despite some valid concerns being raised. I hope that ethics and morals that we so dearly value in this community are kept in mind by the majority when making any decision.

I would like to repeat my belief that no matter how strong a technical/incentive system you develop, it is not going to work w/o the ethical and moral underpinnings and community curation that has been the hallmark of decred.

Risk arises from 

a) the treasury not being fully decentralized and being in the form of an LLC currently (which a regulator could view as a clever AP slush fund/entity).

b) if decisions are unilaterally made by an AP (luckily that's not the case here, since the community is actively deciding these issues).

c) an AP participates in creating a market for Decred, which is literally what Decred Holdings is doing by funding a MM. The point is, an MM will be paid by the Treasury which might or might not be an AP.

MMs were debated a lot and I'm really happy to see this issue being resolved through Pi, but just one week of discussion?

This issue is as big as hiring the PR partner or deciding whether we want to fund the DEX. Let's speak numbers:

PR had cost $120-150K for 6 months. 2 proposals were published Oct 20-21 and went to vote Oct 29. It was coordinated behind the scenes, it was poorly announced via the tiny #proposals room and felt rushed. Lessons were learned: we realized that we need RFP process for such cases and to significantly improve announcement campaigns. We also discussed [longer discussion periods](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/117) for bigger budgets.

DEX had cost $250K for estimated 6 months. This was the best handling of large expense so far. Concept was introduced as early as [June 2018](https://blog.decred.org/2018/06/05/A-New-Kind-of-DEX/) so everybody had enough time to digest it. [RFP proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a) was published Feb 4 and allowed a ton of discussion. I had enough time to [reflect](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/dex/analysis-bee.md) on all pros and cons. Once the discussion mostly died down it went to vote Mar 5. I think 2-3 weeks would be fine, but 1 full month didn't hurt at all.

Fast forward through DEX spec, [DEX dev](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/417607aaedff2942ff3701cdb4eff76637eca4ed7f7ba816e5c0bd2e971602e1) adjusted the cost to $230K and time to ~1 year. Published Aug 7 and vote started Aug 12 - but that's okay because everybody had a ton of time to sync up.

MM proposals have cost $250-300K for 6 months. 3 proposals published Aug 7, RFP published Aug 10, RFP vote started Aug 15. This is a _new_ topic to debate formally and just one week for up to $300K?

I don't know about others, but for me the need for MMs is even less obvious than PR or DEX. I do want to dive in, educate myself, understand why it costs so much and make the best vote choice, but it takes time.

Since this is just an RFP, there is still time to learn and discuss before the real ones go to vote. I hope they won't be rushed like this.",87084e9e6001f32ae77145d185ee6e6727f81144e320b0490331ec180b01f8d5e291c298ba05e2d41b979cb7d0c35e4e3a63285e4e777bb614df19258774bc0a,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,55,cb5c3093d7f4bc253e8b0ad09d1d1814d1fc8d3934a47424d6e6ad13c8d9a7da81e97098d8fe85baa192afb906b6b69d96db044659f9ff11323de8f7d4d4cd0b,1566076714,7,8.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,1.0

**Questions: how does it work?**

I heard in traditional markets exchanges are the ones who fund market makers. Exchanges are in a unique position to audit MM's work because they have full access to all trade data. Why this should be any different in crypto?

Do all coins pay for market making?

Do any crypto exchanges pay for market making like they should?

While trading on a retail exchange I learned that you can get burned. In rare events you can get burned _heavily_ and _quickly_ and never sell/buy back.

What are the failure modes in the worst cases, who will take the damage in case of a ""black swan"" event at the exchange? E.g. if a huge dump or margin/stop-loss collapse, or if the exchange gets hacked?

How MMs handle bull runs? Bear runs? e.g. if their DCR sell side is fully bought out and the price never falls back (it will mean a ton of DCR was sold cheaply). Conversely, if the BTC buy side is fully sold into and the price crashes without recovery.

If MM is confident that they can provide liquidity without burning money, why can't they use their own money?

Why ""just placing buy and sell orders"" cost so much? What makes it so expensive? Isn't it semi-automated? (similar question [here](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/19))

At best I had a vague idea of what a market maker was prior to these proposals.  My biggest concern is that I am not alone in my level of understanding, and that other stakeholders may be in the same boat.  

That said, in the future I think it would be ideal to a) launch an exploratory proposal similar to this one and b) focus on educating voters on the subject at hand during such an exploratory phase.  I think the examples of selling a used car here, etc., provide a good start.  But - this being so high-level, costly, and complex a subject, I would argue it’s worthy of more ELI5 for us non-finance/market experts :-)... maybe even an entire episode of Decred in Depth!  Considering how much has already been written on the subject, it may be helpful to listen to individuals in the community with expertise and stake in Decred discuss the various hypotheses surrounding MMs, illiquidity, etc.

Last, I think “jumping the gun” is a harsh way to put it because I feel like those involved with soliciting proposals from market makers had Decred’s best interest in mind while doing so.

Great question, we can negotiate this but since I'm not willing to share in potential losses they may incur it's probably not acceptable for them to share profit. They will not be making a market with the intention of having net profits though.

Most coins would not ever admit to engaging a MM. We have very little data for comps.

>Does a period of MM have any long term effect, i.e. if we decide to stop it after 6 months, will we return back to our thin books situation?

Yes while active the MM will make for a more orderly market and encourage people who would have otherwise not taken a DCR position to feel comfortable dipping their toes in the water.

>Don't we simply have low liquidity for other reasons? e.g. the sell side is lacking simply because the price is wrong, and it will wake up at a higher price. Or the buy side is thin because of the general lack of interest/awareness like noted here?

You are correct that price fixes everything. Part of the problem is nobody want to be the person that makes the price rise sharply. A MM helps to smooth this process.

>If we are talking about institutional players, why not provide this liquidity via OTC instead? I guess OTCs have less custody risk than retail exchanges? Do institutional investors use retail exchanges at all?

DCR is actually well traded OTC but MM would have less impact there, large players transact in size and the types of support we're talking about would be a rounding error on a typical OTC trade.

>Isn't it good that the big boys are not entering? Isn't it better to have DCR distributed across lots and lots of small fish?

Amusingly enough the groups that have been most vocal about engaging a MM are larger players who are mostly done buying and want the market to be less scary for small players to enter and exit.

I suspect every coin in the top 20 by market cap has MMs operating.

Probably, but likely only for coins like BTC that do tons of volume already.

They need to buy it back and it would come out of the fees they're charging us if they get put in this position. Essentially they could lose money doing their job.

>If MM is confident that they can provide liquidity without burning money, why can't they use their own money?

This isn't directional market making and there's a cost to acquiring the DCR necessary to make the market. In short there are easier places to make money that don't involve complex inventory deals.

>Why ""just placing buy and sell orders"" cost so much? What makes it so expensive? Isn't it semi-automated? (similar question here)

The expensive part is the fact that you are potentially incurring small losses and exchange fees. The bids/asks are all spread out in an automated manner.

1. OTC is for large investors
2. MM really helps smaller retail investors
3. some large players are mostly done buying
4. large players want more comfort and confidence for small players
5. institutional (I assume ""large"") investors want to be able to get out of a position
6. they want ""the market"" to absorb selling pressure, esp. during market contractions

Every currency, store of value, tradable asset needs liquidity. Market makers provide that essential service.  I'm focused on assessing our options and selecting the best value from those that have come to the table.

Nothing is without risks.  I recall the initial process for selecting our PR firm that was somewhat contentious, its yielding dividends now.

We are all part of a grand experiment.  Iteration is a process of trial and error.  I think this experiment is well worth the try.

I think the proposals thus far have gotten a lot of engagement and we are on the path to getting a final list of proposals that we can vote on.

While I think a lot of burden should be placed on Market Makers to provide answers to our questions and refine their proposals, I also think anyone planning to vote should also do some individual DD to make sure they have all the information they need to make a sound decision (which ever way they actually vote).  Some independent research on google would be a good idea.

If we onboard those who were blocked by liquidity, what kind of people will we get?

Exising stakeholders myself included managed to obtain DCR regardless of all the barriers. For a certain subset, the core values of Decred were far more important than liquidity issues. If a person is considering Decred but is ""blocked"" by liquidity, he can't even what, wait a little or market buy? It means for him these values are less important. He might barely care about what Decred is about.

In other words, isn't this liquidity barrier similar to the barrier for becoming a contractor that filters out those who aren't serious or don't care much?",3e3a48ee7039f280d50e11fd5f0701ddd9f848b66c0726744846c39455f5d83683e8b691859dc0c5079a180528e920b56f07289d9708f4fde28545a64a5caf07,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,73,b857e67107f3abb62882b5531f7b2e5cd4850db88938731c590ed8f1659ecf751f39acffbbff8f733a151f12436266fa0fd42ee5b37ecf1be0beaf97e192fb0f,1566302153,4,4.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

MMs will only provide maker liquidity, they will be passive in the market and will not be placing active trades. MMs will not be actively buying or selling, only providing the opposite side to other peoples trades.

Furthermore, many of the issues Jango raised (following my further research) are strongly associated with securities, not commodities or currencies.

With four hours left it might not really matter. I believe my questions are still valid. If the MM doesn't increase the use of decred as a means of exchange and it is cheaper to add 2-3% to contractor pay then in my opinion that would be a better use of treasury money in my opinion. That is why I asked the questions to begin with.

Would the cost of adding 2-3% on top of contractors pay end up being more or less than that amount paid to the MM?

Will a MM encourage people to use decred as a MoE?

**Ideas**

I suggest to make it as discoverable as possible:

- Add labels to GitHub repository (Decred, cryptocurrency, blockchain)
- Publish it in popular package repositories (PyPI, others?)
- Announce the package in relevant dev blogs (Hacker Noon, others?)
- Submit it to relevant discussion platforms (find blockchain/python/dev subreddits, HackerNews, etc)
- Write tutorial dev articles (e.g. ""Watching Decred Treasury in Python"", ""Watching Decred airdrop addresses in Python"")
- Host workshops with building on Decred in Python
- If it becomes popular, package for popular distros (Arch, Debian, etc)

**Questions**

This proposal asks to compensate past work but I'm not seeing the budget for future development - what is the funding plan?

> As a Decred project, TinyDecred will enjoy all the benefits and suffer all the scrutiny associated with official Decred projects.

Since this involves other people, I'd like to hear from decred organization maintainers - would they accept and maintain this repo? Are there any Python seniors to look after it?

Are people available for initial code review?

How many dependencies does it have? Are they well maintained? Do they have large codebases? Did anybody audit them?

Do you plan organizing an internal or external audit of the critical parts of the code (e.g. crypto, handling hostile data, etc)?

> An experimental PyQt5 GUI wallet.

Will it be packaged in such a way that a sole library dependency can be installed without pulling in the GUI? Would it be better to have separate repositories for the library and the user-facing wallet?",9c0c2bec5660ea9bf9e5234c21697b60faa75b3fd35672ecb1790fccc327223ea82169348e60adbd15b80741f8ada58521d5a528ea3b0d73a32e03d3ba4a690f,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,13,d924c78a225a6baebccf507e734a8cca658456e08442ae8c5efe919e03e706365d8df6f74107e82a5383b56bd7b235a88c03f7b1c2d434bb83ba0180a9c4a900,1564911183,7,7.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

PyPI is a must, and I'm more than open to blogging, tutorials, and workshops. 

> This proposal asks to compensate past work but I'm not seeing the budget for future development - what is the funding plan?

Good question. Because Decred is pioneering a new type of decentralized workplace, the rules are sometimes being written as we go. 
When I first asked about getting this work brought in, it was even mentioned that this would be a test case for this Shark-Tank style of contribution.

I'd like to hear from others on this topic, but here is my best understanding. 
Once brought under the Decred umbrella, hours for development and maintenance would not be pre-approved via proposal.
Instead, development expenditures are tacitly 
[approved by the stakeholders through the contractor system](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f).
I would also make it a point to request approval via proposal for any work that varies significantly from the path described here.
Stakeholders would, of course, hold the power to halt development on the project or even reverse this proposal if they don't like the direction it's going. 

> Are people available for initial code review?

I'm hoping to get a solid endorsement for you, but nobody has deep dived yet. I'll try to get you something soon.
I certainly invite everyone to have a look at things and run some tests. 
Unit tests are implemented via Python's built-in [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) framework.
I'm not saying everything's perfect. There are a couple of design choices that even I question, but they are relatively low-impact and easy to path correct. Part of the reason I'd like to get this work brought in is because I'll have a larger pool of expertise to draw from.

> How many dependencies does it have? Are they well maintained? Do they have large codebases? Did anybody audit them?

All dependencies can be installed through PyPI with

    pip install PyQt5 websocket_client blake256 base58 pynacl appdirs

So just 6 dependencies, and I would consider them all well-maintained. `PyQt5` is the only one that I'd consider irreplaceable, and it's only needed if using the GUI wallet (more comments below).
I agree that dependency auditing is super important, so I would definitely be doing that before any releases.

> Do you plan organizing an internal or external audit of the critical parts of the code (e.g. crypto, handling hostile data, etc)?

Internal auditing via code reviews and good unit testing always. External auditing would need to be stakeholder-approved, I think, but definitely open to it. There has been some broader discussion of external auditing elsewhere. I think things are still evolving on that front. 

> Will it be packaged in such a way that a sole library dependency can be installed without pulling in the GUI? Would it be better to have separate repositories for the library and the user-facing wallet?

I think it makes a lot of sense for this to be released as two separate PyPI packages. 
I'd like to keep things in one parent repo, but I'm not married to it. 
My reasoning is that these two major parts are going to develop in lock-step for the forseeable future. 
Want for a new feature on the GUI wallet will drive implementation of lower-level features. 
Often it will be desirable to make changes to both as a single pull request.",f6bbeca1c7b6e79a4baa3ce4b526e3d1f33ae0963e8f7079107c08bdd2d76fc863f0aab8e61f1bb5ae18c09f79c58aeab9d32d14bcb625ddfd3637a3f2dd570c,7e0d27a299b37423a7951e30361c178fdd6cbdc731b62a6c33c1185aabd5e60a,15,eed496df54f42f3bb118e7ef88cbc9cdc67105c8b7ae41b1aaf643f591534d0ecc1c799b98294638d133625e2c53e18bed3a6b95c29fda0f21812a7b6b588f0d,1564933575,4,4.0,False,4bfa47b8-b43c-4c7d-a385-5e1787829624,buck54321,

- The code appears to be well structured, and functions are well documented.

As far as utility, I think Python (the ""swiss army knife"" of programming languages), will make it easier for a broader group of developers to do many things, including, off the top of my head:

- Automation of simple wallet functionality (creating wallets, checking balances, transferring DCR, etc.). This could be useful in a number of contexts, including portfolio management, security (e.g. simulating attacks), privacy, etc. 
- Integrations with third party websites that aggregate/analyze blockchain data; Python is a popular language for web backends.

Despite their ubiquity, application of these concepts to the modern software industry is just beginning.

You should either have absorbed the cost overruns, learned from the first round, and then proposed a clean new proposal based on a better understanding of the real costs.

While Dennis has indeed generated the videos, as agreed upon, he is asking for 10 times the original amount quoted for the videos  USD 7,500 instead of USD 750.  This was such a massive departure from what I have seen in the past, with respect to contractor billing, that I felt it needed to go up as its own proposal, which was communicated to Dennis.

First, let’s have a quick look at [Dennis’ previous cryptocurrency videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/dennislovejoy).  From what I see here, I would expect a video tutorial to be 5-10 minutes in length.  These videos have runtimes of roughly 30, 19, 28, 17, 17 and 14 minutes, for a total of 125 minutes of video.  The runtime is much longer than I or any stakeholder would have expected from looking at Dennis’ existing videos.

Speaking generally, I would only consider it acceptable for a proposal to go a few 10s of percent over budget, but to go 900% over budget is just absurd.  If the quality of the videos was truly exceptional, it might be a justifiable cost, however, it is not reasonable for a contractor to go ahead and complete all this work without prior stakeholder approval and expect for it to be paid for after-the-fact.  Dennis did in fact attempt to invoice for the entire USD 7,500 after completing the work, and, after consulting with some of the other contractors, I came to the conclusion that Dennis, and any other contractor who invoices beyond their budgets outlined in their proposal, should submit an additional proposal for the billing beyond the original proposal.

After having watched several of the videos, here is a summary of my feedback:

* The videos are easily twice as long as they should be.
* Based on how long the videos are, I expect they will receive very few views.
* The level of detail in the content of the videos is pretty good.
* Lots of runtime is devoted to things that occur to me as out-of-scope, e.g. finding websites, checking websites are ‘secure’, creating logins, using email, using password managers, using exchanges, etc.
* The editing of the video in the PIP video is very choppy.  There is an edit every several seconds.
* The PIP provides limited utility in the video - I am left looking at video of Dennis looking at a screen.
* There are effectively advertisements embedded in the videos for various service/software providers, e.g. keepass.info, DashLane, Tutanota.
* A lot of focus is put on relatively intuitive processes, e.g. filling out forms, clicking on buttons, etc.
* There is no use of testnet to demonstrate ticket purchases or similar, despite it being the best way to demonstrate various processes since it does not bleed information about mainnet coins.
* There are factual errors in some important statements, e.g. that voting on proposals generates a reward.

Based on my perception of the videos as low quality (for the reasons listed above), I think that it is totally unreasonable to pay the requested amount for the videos.  Even if Dennis accepts the originally proposed amount for the videos, USD 750, I expect they will not garner many views.  More importantly than Dennis’ requested payment of USD 7,500 for this work, we must consider the precedent set by paying for work that is performed in this fashion.  While I consider it likely that Dennis’ behavior here was not malicious, this cuts incredibly close to a standard bait-and-switch setup: someone gets a proposal approved for amount X, then intentionally expands the scope and bills for 10X.

I will be voting against this proposal, and any other proposal that I feel requests an unacceptable increase in budget.  While I am not keen to deprive anyone of compensation for their time, allowing contractors to behave in this fashion would set an awful precedent for Decred.  It is expected that anyone creating proposals for the project has the self-management capability to avoid situations like this, so the responsibility for having gotten into this situation rests squarely with the proposer, not the stakeholders.",dcfbc89614777aa61f66b586c8e85e00456cb3547b808ea5831a06116cbadfc2b6bdc995b81afb00fc9db4e0aa2fbd59dd5bf66b68f18b7e0213beae5819780c,e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360,2,9241448341ed57cd0677654604648d6f7fa3d785886887378f6c624babfbdc00288d296ee86bba3857cbce1ea3b81795ee360c0265484d9cbc6001ff6b5f1e08,1561493203,5,5.0,False,fe62dd6a-2cc6-4d41-abd0-522528d33ae7,jy-p,

It may still be palatable if it's only a 20-30% increase (but even that is a bad idea). To put things in perspective, let's say if the original approved budget was $10,000, the overrun will be now be a whopping $100k instead!  How about that?

While i empathized your situation, i think that agreeing to this proposal will set a very bad precedent for future proposals (which has been highlighted numerous times by others).  You should have kept to your original deliverable (3 videos) before making another proposal with a completely new budget if you feel the need to extend further. By doing that, you will limit your overrun and also the the damage caused to yourself in case thing doesn't go your way. ""Going the extra miles"" is definitely not the way to go here, unless the deliverable are of exceptional qualities and way above expectations, but let's not go into that now. 

At the moment, you are only risking yourself of not being compensated fairly which i think is a real possibility here.  I'm sorry for being blunt, but i think you may have to learn this the hard way and to absorb the losses this time round and come out smarter next time. 

Either way, i truly appreciate your deliverable so far, and while i don't have any real complaint regarding the videos, i also think that there are still room for improvement in term of video length and making the deliveries more concise.

No matter what the outcome is, i certainly hope that you will not harbor any grudge or ill intention towards this project should this proposal fails.

Firstly the practice of changing funding this significantly, while there is a clear cut scope, should not take root as a common and accepted approach. ""Re: Why?"" A more common sense question for the stakeholders to ask self in any similar case, is whether this approach would pass in the real life example – ie. when you're in a role of a client or let's say this request being made against an average company. The proposed work costs 750$, but then a bill is sent for 7500$. Does not compute.

If the estimated hours don't hold, then address it right away. Whether the action is eating up some hours on your end to ensure delivery, terminating the project or some compromise via updated proposal as this one. Using additional out-of-scope work as an inducement to push through this proposal is a somewhat unethical business practice.

Secondly the hours breakdown contains over 12+ full days (77h+14h) listed purely as ""Editing"" and ""Uploading & Publishing"". This averages 2 full days per clip and is absolutely over the top. Very basic editing req. of cutting together screen + cam recordings with some fine tuning on top simply does not take longer than 2-4 hours per video (of this length). 

A main reason why I've voted yes for the initial proposal was cost efficiency + speed, that being someone quickly cranking out simple and useful content.

As mentioned in many of the comments here, the amount of overrun is excessive, and the treasury will not be held to pay for the estimation mistake. Furthermore, paying for large overruns sets a precedent that opens the treasury to bait-and-switch tactics.

While Denni seemed to be generally aware of the risk he was taking here putting in all the extra hours, it does appear, from the public chats anyway, that there may have been some mixed signals from the project. And whichever way this goes, I think we can learn from this. Below is a rough summary of the conversation as I saw it unfolding in public chats (all I've seen). 

* Denni’s proposal is approved
* He iterates with community members in #writers. He’s generally enthusiastic and responsive (he made a small change I suggested). He goes way over hours by incorporating every suggested change, even though the scope is increasing beyond the original proposal. 
* He does not (publicly) report that he’s gone over hours until April 25th ([Matrix link](https://matrix.to/#/!RkRLpGpvNverwzVyVV:decred.org/$155623865827953mTuEs:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org)). He reports that he’s at 92 hours, which “well exceeds the time scheduled in my proposal (25 hours)”, and proposes the possibility of becoming a contractor and billing for the overages that way. 
* Some responses to this suggestion were supportive, but a number of comments were against this, arguing it would set bad precedent. 
* On May 14th, Denni announces in recruiting ([Matrix link](https://matrix.to/#/!RkRLpGpvNverwzVyVV:decred.org/$155786985713501sdhoK:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org)) that after the proposal, he’ll continue forward as a contractor and send the invoice for the extra hours. He is told by a community member that, “I’m sure it will be approved”. Nobody else replies.
* On 6/3, a community member asks why Denni (presumably even further over budget at this point, but not (publicly) reporting out hours), has not submitted an invoice for May. 
* Denni reports that he’s not yet in the contractor management system, and that technically the proposal is done (initial 3 videos), but that he’s waiting on review from other community members, and should only need a week or so to finish the “post-proposal updates (6 total videos)”. He plans to submit an invoice at the end of June. A community member expresses opposition to this plan, saying that moving forward work needs to be tied to a proposal. Denni says that’s fine, thanks the comments for the clarification. There appears to be some confusion here, and presumably Denni assumes this is going to be billed under the approved Marketing budget?
* An invoice for 10x the original amount is submitted. There is community pushback, and Denni is asked to submit a proposal for the overage. 
* Denni agrees, and here we are.

While I agree this price is still too high, based on imagined ROI, and paying this could set a bad precedent, I do have some sympathy for Denni. If I imagine myself in his situation (and I was a new contractor not that long ago), it’s easy to see how he might be confused. Especially if he’s new to freelancing and open source development. At the same time, it’s clear he was also taking on a lot of risk, with comments from the community that indicate opposition to paying over budget. I assume good intentions on Denni’s part (presumably he’s just an enthusiastic freelancer that hasn’t learned the hard lesson of how to estimate work and set boundaries; every freelancer learns this one the hard way). The question is, how much of this lesson should the project pay for, if any. Would be curious to hear Denni's side of this, and what his perception of the situation was as he was going over budget.",b5df6b96b9df45b87723a79eed50e0a1f612db887f9c8530c2ad68d7543ec95dbd2d895401360acbd1196a9ac9d5f818b3697a63b667f8997981d2eefd373f0b,1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73,7,07ed7f116d08b0c056f244b67f9704622351333e3267434e889445b8c1eb77a00c9a10d940b35bc4dd4410c247437bbffa60a9c118fe37debdaf862b1c3e2203,1561608388,3,3.0,False,107efb48-3ab1-4830-8b69-35842ca010de,s_ben,

Moving forward, I’ll be abandoning this proposal and deliver the 3 tutorials at the agreed upon price of $750 and will do the next proposal much cleaner. 
Yes, I’m fine with absorbing the costs. I’m chalking it up as a loss and learning experience & really shouldn't have made the mistake of overrunning. That’s my fault and I apologize to all the stakeholders for the mistakes and confusion from my end.

My intent has always been to give value. When pushback occurred regarding the overruns, it became clear to me that I was extracting value and in no way will I allow the first deal to get in the way of building goodwill with the community.

Some relevant background: Checkmate and I have discussed their becoming a Decred contractor and contributing to the project's research effort (and more broadly). While there is some scope for Checkmate and I to collaborate on the [Decred Open Source Research program](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/67de0e901143400ae2f247391c4d5028719ffea8308fbc5854745ad859fb993f), Checkmate's research interests and skills are quite different to mine. Checkmate shared a bullet-point list of subjects they would like to cover, and I suggested to develop it into a proposal and pursue it independently (if the proposal is approved).

From an organizational perspective, this approach makes more sense to me than trying to fit Checkmate's research into the open source research program. Having the proposed work be part of the established program would make me responsible for deciding which aspects are worthwhile and for overseeing the work, and I would be accountable for those decisions when it's time for the next open source research proposal. This would not be a great setup for anyone. Checkmate's approach is different enough to my own that it should have its own proposal and be evaluated independently. 

I will be voting Yes, I think $2,000 is reasonable for the work already done and a further $12,000 should provide enough runway to develop this approach and for us to see how it progresses - which can inform stakeholder voting on any subsequent proposal.

In general, this approach of approving budgets for specific research programs led by specific individuals or small groups feels like a good fit to me. The nature of research is such that one can't guarantee what the outcome will look like, as it will depend on how the research unfolds. Therefore I think it makes sense to handle funding on the basis of programs where specific individuals/groups lead research efforts in specific areas, with proposals that span fairly short periods of time (3-12 months) and are therefore regularly reviewed by stakeholders.",179b4817df2fee9d6b8155bcedbd15b0b03c0fd7e0d0b48944c160073e3369b914e29c65cf2834e3e948ebcf845daa6e46e3febfa7f62331b762528b531ca103,cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e,1,180b5e3c61413a26eeafbfad39ec73e5f77199699821a251211ae1ab134bb231072702199e3dbd1d15a334e8bce10a5eaeaa7a13d6b0ecfc5690a6c8fb9a7700,1563457016,9,9.0,False,350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c,richard-red,

In my view this would be a good kind of precedent to set - it tells prospective contributors that they can get on with contributing to the project now and if the stakeholders see value in their work they can be paid for it later. This fits with Decred's approach to approving contractors, where they must demonstrate the quality of their work product before being allowed to bill for it.

The unusual proposal you refer to was handled well and created a _good_ precedent, IMO. The contractor received an initial approval from stakeholders, started work, burned the initial budget quickly and went into deep overrun without notifying about his underestimation timely (i.e. _before_ overrunning), nor about extra budget necessary to continue. On top of that, he went over with extra work not in scope of the initial proposal. Judging this was too much for Treasury managers and the only good way to resolve this was to submit a proposal, which was done. The proposal received strong opposition, I guess mainly because it was a huge surprise for everyone. The proposal was abandoned (i.e. not approved), and I think it is now a great precedent that would prevent similar undesirable behavior, not invite new one.

Perhaps I did not fully grasp your concern though.

As for paying for past work done without prior approval, it's totally fine. It all boils down to what we get vs what we pay.

Denni's [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d8d7ff7ad138ed322422aaa4d2a3e1c61f296ae56a2c2316cc5ecd10cf8dd8bd) asking for payment in arrears was a corner case resulting from his going way over budget before he became a contractor as a means to recoup that work (and I haven't seen him around for a while...). Checkmate's situation is of being the first to go through the proper process of becoming a contractor with the expectation of needing stakeholder approval for his funding. 

The basic official contractor path (or the traditional one anyway, which hasn't been changed afaik), is:

1. Work and demonstrate value
2. Ask to become a contractor (or be asked)
3. In your first invoice, bill in arrears for the free work you did knowing you may never get paid for it (i.e. you proved skin-in-the-game by taking on risk, and get rewarded if that bet pays off). I think this is fair, and an important value proposition to new contractors who are already making a large leap of faith by doing what can be a large amount of work for free (and that can happen). 

I think the amount asked for is reasonable, especially considering his work has already proved popular/valuable (e.g. already it has been included in an [investment thesis](https://www.blockheadcap.com/post/decred-investment-thesis), presumably by people buying into DCR and increasing the price). What's new here is that this process is now going through stakeholder approval, not just the normal invoicing process. Would be curious to know if there has been a change in process, or if this is just checkmate wanting to err on the side of transparency and giving the stakeholders an avenue to voice their opinion on the matter. 

To add a data point to this, when I went through the process of becoming a contract (back in October, right as Politeia was launching), I decided not to bill in arrears for prior work I'd done, even though I was told I could and it was a decent chunk of work, because I was very eager to impress and grateful for the opportunity. However, I also realized that that possibility/promise of getting paid for that work was a big factor in my deciding to take the plunge and go for it. And I told myself that if I had the opportunity to speak up for this practice generally I would take it, hence this comment. 

Am curious to hear any stakeholder opinions on this.",cc88288586e93c12dda893ea1c396f9e8f4ffa25aa46dbfeef4f521025ac9bdac76fbebf482c3bb9ae6f96463c70061c9f33585a4690417c4cf6b83e98066a06,1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73,7,60bd46dfad1f04203a277f23a3c1b3643769dc8b88de28dea931ee70001d4125e22c59a30245f14c65ff7cc577fe5a91d53fd4d2a92a0f1c4ada744c16aa450d,1563577013,7,7.0,False,107efb48-3ab1-4830-8b69-35842ca010de,s_ben,

Quite frankly, this person is a breath of fresh air and has already proved value within the community.

I also appreciate their willingness to engage with all sorts, including those critical of the project, and have civilized discussion.

Therefore, I support its continuation.

For a particular example of the quality of the current individuals running the program, one of the most challenging aspects of these bug bounty programs is typically the large number of invalid or trivial submissions that waste valuable developer time.  This can be seen by the numbers shared in the proposal which show that 84.5% of all submission have been invalid.  Nevertheless, the  way the program has handled the vetting process to screen out these time wasting submissions has been exemplary to date.

In regards to the final note, I think it's important to maintain a time frame in addition to a budget.  While there will always be a need for a bug bounty program, and when looking at it in that light, it might make sense to consider not attaching a time frame to it, these proposals apply to more than just the idea of program itself.

* The program requires qualified people to run it, and there is no guarantee that there are willing participants on an indefinite scale
* I would not be in support of the program if it were to become poorly managed due to personnel turnover
* I am generally not in favor of any type of proposals which involve indefinite payouts as it does not properly align the incentives and makes it much harder to keep things running smoothly over time when it becomes overly difficult to course correct when unforeseen circumstances occur",9aa4541720701f1518f1ea0c213771cc9529dce31dc1838883ec6e3b0063e3a17e62b05f89998bffa228f3f0ae599c3667e2b998c838e8926ebb25c4f0991302,937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b,4,c0277ab366549e14600b7447c6cb7ae7b3aac8842d67e242f9848d620053551c0f30e32d58712788a67f955da2c609cf607bcc5e646d6241af080e0829143a04,1560986682,7,7.0,False,7a982526-e44b-4ced-9924-0f4401861c05,davecgh,

I am reticent to back this proposal without a massive change of directions or complete abandonment and re-write. 

This proposal is potentially an end around the current contractor model we already have in place (not that I think that's the intention), it could damage a lot of the progress and positive cultural value that has been derived from it, and also curtail additional value we would surely gain from protecting the integrity of the contractor model in place.

I think Decred could be exposed to adverse selection, while we may find quality people, we will still have no experiential knowledge of their long term dedication to Decred until some point into the 12 months process.

In addition we will have committed to some evangelists that we discover are not the ""right fit"".well before the 12 months is up, but we are still beholden to through the end of the 12 month term?

To a large extent I already see every contractor at Decred and many more community participants as evangelists.  I'm sure a great majority own DCR, and already have ample incentive to fulfill a majority of the functions you outline above. 

Decred may be better off just stoking our community members that have already shown alignment and skin in the game to enhance this evangelist mandate that many already hold.

Lastly, the proposed path could undercut and disincentivize our aforementioned contractors that are already compensated and reflexively fulfilling the role of evangelists.

Why not simply approach potential BD opportunities as an independent entity that pitches and sells the idea of building on Decred to external parties? One would have the flexibility to structure any engagement as one sees fit with any external party and get enumerated independent of the Decred treasury..  

So rather than Decred funding BD teams, Decred's open infrastructure can be leveraged to the benefit of any individual or entity with the wherewithal to structure a $250,000 to $10 million contract as you state above.

7,cb446a469987d6603d93f442ef0d4e45bacbea47a72b5ce89f9c3cac3868d627,1,"Thank you for the feedback.  

I understand the critiques. Definitely, I felt some of the same tensions when I put on my community member hat to review my own proposal.  

Thanks for giving me a chance to explain my thought processes in arriving at this particular framing, and I look forward to the dialogue that unfolds. 

I am a big believer that through dialogue we can sharpen our ideas, planning, and execution.

Let me start by saying, I have zero pride in the ideas put forward, and my singular goal is in driving towards the success of the Decred 'digital sovereign' economy.

In an earlier draft of the proposal, I had tried to make the selection of the BD evangelists something that would happen based on a rolling 3-month community vote based process, but then, just before agreeing to let the proposal go live, I changed the mechanism to a more traditional method of hiring and firing, for fear that the rolling-vote just wouldn’t be pragmatic, for three reasons, (1) I wouldn’t be able to design a mechanism to administer the rolling vote, (2) if I tried to it would be a distraction to the real goal of getting deals done for Decred with a sense of urgency as this entire space is heating up and Decred community members want to put points on the board, and (3) I wanted to ensure adherence to some deep beliefs that I’ve learned thru practical experience building BD teams.   

As context, in the organizations I've built to date in my career I've hired ~ 400 people, and let-go ~ 100 of them, and about 40 of these people have been BD focused, so I have some experience with how difficult it is to build and manage high-performance teams, including BD teams, and have a lot of scars, successes, and some deep beliefs anchored in these years of learnings. 

Since I am personally aligned with Decred's future with my time and resources at a significant and meaningful level of commitment, I got started with the proposal process with an ‘owner’s mentality’ wanting to make Decred successful to maximum possible extent in short-, medium-, and long-term.  

Thus, I wanted to put forward a model where I can bring to the table the best of what I've learned thru my personal experiences building high-performance BD teams to commercialize new technology, which includes three key lessons after many years of trial-and-error learning: 

(a) BD specialists compensation should be primarily performance-based since most of the time they fail to deliver anything of any use (i.e. they should 'eat what they kill'), 

(b) by aligning interests of a dozen BD specialists with relationship access to different organizations and industries we can run lots of BD pitches and experiments in parallel to learn by trial-and-error where the ""spaghetti sticks to the wall"", i.e. where we have ""product market fit"", and 

(c) we want to establish a culture whereby BD specialists who are not putting their heart and soul into winning results are quickly released to pursue other passions w/ an open, direct, positive, and encouraging exit-interview.

Re this last point, we call this 'hatch and release' in the tech company I lead today, which I believe is a term coined at Genentech where ruthlessness in 'hatch and release' has been attributed to the strength and success of the Genentech's current team and culture by some of the long-time veterans there.  (Generally, 'hatch and release' within 30 days would be a great model to follow for the entire Decred contractor community, imho, whether we are talking about BD contractors or otherwise.)

Definitely, aspirationally, as I said above, I had initially and instinctively wanted to try and make the selection and release of the contractors community-based, to be more consistent with Decred community values, with some kind of rolling vote process.  However, from an implementation standpoint, I didn't know how to quickly or effectively implement the ""hatch and release"" idea, which really is done through personal relationships, and requires the assessment of many human factors, i.e. effort, punctuality, body language, communication, etc., and also requires seeing whites-of-eyeballs and hearing tone of voice when discussing client relationships, closing likelihoods, ‘knock backs’, lessons learned, etc.  I really, genuinely honestly don’t know how the entire Decred community can be involved in such a process of managing if/when ‘hatch & release’ needs to happen, at least not in a way that is efficient.

As a separate item, I don't understand enough about how the current contractor platform works to know if I could build on the infra in some way to accomplish some or all of my intended result.  If someone has suggestions for how to accomplish the three intended principles (including, especially, 'hatch and release') in a way that is more consistent with the Decred contractor management system and norms that we have today, I am super open-minded about re-working the entire proposal.  Again, I have zero pride, and I'm only trying to help Decred succeed.  

That being said, I would prefer not to relax on adhering to any of these three principles stated above, as, for me, keeping to these three key principles are what I know from my empirical experience can bring about success in commercializing new technology and exploring many major industries and prospective partnerships to find product market fit quickly & at lowest cost.

So, to my thought process, since I didn't know how to accomplish these three principles using the current contractor model, basically, in a spirit of pragmatism, I defaulted to asking the Decred community to ""trust me"" in administering a BD program through personal relationships, with my reputation as a contractor on the line in delivering it, and with the 'centralized trust' that the Decred community would bestow upon me to run a small team limited to a 1-year experimental program.  

Basically, this procurement model that I'm suggesting Decred follow to retain my services is similar to how a government grants a concession to a contractor to operate a metro or airport for a fixed period of time, or to protect the green zone in a war torn country, etc. etc.

Re my thinking about a 1-year term, that was based on the insight that the enterprise sales cycle is typically 6-months to 18-months, and recruiting BD specialists (many of whom are busy, successful people w/ day jobs), educating them on Decred, getting pitch materials prepared, making pitches, gathering feedback, tweaking pitches, discussing pricing, going to exec level, drafting proposals to the Treasury, etc. is going to require a year or so to programmatically bear fruit.  Probably 18-months would be safer, but, I proposed 1-year as I thought it would be the minimum responsible time to seeing indications of progress.

In the spirit of pragmatism, since the BD evangelists would not actually be paid by Decred directly, but instead are earning a % of ‘match funds’ that they bring to the Treasury from external customer organizations, the cash outlay from the Decred Treasury to the BD specialists would be zero, and the risk-return proposition to the community of the proposal would be very good.

I should note, the process I would follow in recruiting BD contractors would emphasize aligning experienced BD specialists (some of whom will be employed at major top 20 tech companies) who have existing relationships where they have sold technology before and have helped their customers be successful.  If we can make pitches thru their existing relationships, without wasting a lot of time needing to develop and nurture new sales leads, we can short-circuit the regular sales cycle and process of forming personal trust with sales leads to a certain extent.",d5cbfa5116cde888e6d2ad820897bc1cb15b50fdd1f2ae7dc2874c0cdb98826199be83f84413da87f8b7b9078112f2920411de9d2f9af6799332770442949507,dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079,3,a7a8902bada194d2b259ebee4c1ee034be43a8eb133c59875111ec2de4a5f13e3bc6cee50d6fe8091cf4901a0cc0efe97b6debe7d73bb850021284314a38550e,1559114190,0,,False,0b4b0bb2-e406-40e2-9d08-8b6711fefb18,betterfuture,

Hypothetically, Decred can procure work at level of individual human beings for specific tasks (like the Epstein proposal in voting now); teams of many people for projects that might contain hundreds of tasks (such as this proposal, here), or entire organizations with hundreds of people for major programs that might contain many sub-projects  and thousands of tasks.    (probably the latter option to procure entire programs would be impossible at current price of DCR , but, if together we can grow this economy to $10B market cap... and the Treasury has a billion to allocate, could we get there?). From what I’ve read online, I believe that the Decred founders wanted to have an ability to procure ""entire teams"", with experienced managers coordinating these teams towards the accomplishment of larger goals that the community might prioritize accomplishing.  If this is truly the intention, then perhaps community members can view the present proposal not as circumventing the ""single human-being contractor hiring system"", but instead as a complementary mechanism to procuring performance-oriented teams.

+++

In summary, as a new prospective contractor, it would be helpful for me to understand answers to the following questions so that I can think about re-working the proposal once all of the feedback has been collected:

(1) Scope of Contracts Awarded.  Does the Decred community have a view on what is the ""most efficient unit of procurement""?  Is hiring high-performance “teams” a priority?

(2) Decred Contractor Management System.  Are there any ways that we might utilize the contractor management system in the proposal that I've put forward here, and also adhere to the three principles of running a successful BD organization that I've also outlined, above?

(3) Community Norms and Processes. Are there any suggestions on how I might re-work the proposal in a way that would be more consistent with community norms and processes established to date?",267cc61773d902831d25ae308e80f639130f0d4ae8763cea742d027cb6909b12563fb5b187f797ee507731d30ede9814c2fb5b0480f881bd394695ac2d590503,dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079,4,0aad7edf0c5aa1ed72bfe3c96daf465cd18eaecf1ef213c4d1dbd60920b678b0f03cec28424a288da88540ea976666dd3d733e9be814718b31dba4a8473ace0e,1559114531,0,,False,0b4b0bb2-e406-40e2-9d08-8b6711fefb18,betterfuture,

 -- I think part of the reason the optics of the proposal elicited a feeling that it is ""potentially an end around the current contractor model"" is that I tried to frame it as an open Decred BD program, whereas, instead, I should have proposed it as offering a high-performance team that would operate and function similar to Company 0 or Ditto.

 -- Where the framing got confused, is that I tried to propose a hybrid model that would strike a balance _between_ bringing to the table a high-performance team (with a goal of putting points on the board for Decred as fast as possible) _with also _opening-up access to apply to join this team thru_an 'open access system' (with a goal of making the program more inclusive in line with Decred's _open community values_).  My thinking was that this hybrid model could empower anyone within the community to apply to become a BD Evangelist on the team, including especially existing contractors who have shown loyalty, commitment, etc.   Probably my intuition to balance these two goals of _high-performance team_ with _open-access to apply to join _wasn't immediately obvious. 

 -- As a thought experiment, how do you think you would react if I re-wrote the proposal to offer an experienced Silicon Valley BD team, i.e., 5 to 7 individuals with current or recent day jobs at Apple, Bosch, Cisco, Google, Oracle, Symantec, VMWare, etc. The goal of this fit-for-purpose BD team would be to explore if there is a market opportunity to sell Decred infrastructure to large tech companies and enterprises who might be compelled to build on top of this infrastructure, but might need to pay a contractor within the ecosystem to build an adapter, App, extension.  In addition to coordinating such a team, and getting the team up the learning curve and pitching to targets, and quickly doing ""hatch and release"" with team non-performing team members, we would also seek to involve the subset of community members who applied to join the team in an inclusive way.

 -- Re the philosophical question of ""optimal unit of procurement for Decred"", I believe that for the next 18 months or so while Decred sits in the $250m to $2.5b scale the optimal procurement model is to hire single ""high-performance teams"" with very specific goals and objectives set forth in each proposal contract, and then cutting the team off from future contracts if they don't meet or beat expectations.  Such a team would typically comprise 1 team lead,  3-15 team members, and a 3-12 month scope of work.

Thank you for this proposals, it definitely is something new that we have yet to discuss as a community. At first glance, I must say that I see a few major technical issues that could make difficult to get any benefit from the efforts of eventual BD evangelists.

But before that, I have to assume that this proposal would genuinely bring valuable contributions to Decred and that associations or agreements would be productive partnerships. I'm sad to say that I know very few of these partnerships in the CC space that consist of more than : ""We use your big corp name for marketing and hype, and in exchange you use ""blockchain"" and other nice keywords so you appear to be up to date with what's popular in the media"".

So let's say we do have valuable partnership opportunities, the first problem I see is which legal entity from Decred can sign such partnership or agreement? In the decentralized world we are building, there is no central or legal entity that can take that role. Giving that role to an ""elected"" representative would be voting for centralization, and having contractors take that role, could expose them to legal obligations they have no way of enforcing because they do not control Decred and What stakeholders decide.

Then, there is the problem of who can provide the work (dev, support, etc) from the Decred side, to meet the requirements of such partnership? Our current model doesn't allow stakeholders to dictate what contractors do, or if they want to work on X or Y. The model has been described for a while as ""bring your own devs"",  so that proposals must include all steps and provide the actual means for its completion.  In the case that an evangelist were to strike a big deal, it would be impossible to assign any new task to the current dev workforce, and probably dangerous to burden individuals who may or may not be interested in that work. Otherwise, if the tasks rely only on the partnered business, there's no need for a partnership in the first place.


I do however agree that there's a place for BD around Decred. In some way, anyone already has the legitimacy to act as an ""evangelist"" or to approach potential businesses. I see partnerships and agreements more as complete proposals that stakeholders could vote on. For example, someone could envision time-stamping youtube videos, gather a small team of devs, and leverage contacts at Google, to write up a joint proposal for it.

If you're familiar with the ""Building on Bitcoin"" initiative and events,  I believe this ""model"" makes a lot more sense to bring businesses around a cryptocurrency like Decred.  And we do have many unique traits that makes ""Building on Decred"" really attractive,  from getting paid for contributions, to leveraging the whole open-source ecosystem like politeia, dcrtime, CMS, lightning network, etc... and our vibrant community of devs, stakeholders and enthusiasts.",6ce15c876f6d8311d85b2a67b7e50279f58050a2e0053fe496cc1f7344026fb49d10227fbe0c8cd9cb3043d599fba0108f1acfbe062e1d27cb326d076029930a,0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9,7,ede1e85c5c32cdbac0d93b945e38f5cb4ce3f5cf005bb4384492108fedc7dbfdb934436c2743517ed65ee4fec1c57792d84cd21e01b049db1016b515cb5cff02,1559264970,6,6.0,False,3ffa2992-ace9-4a7d-abce-51872469e765,nnnko56,

Yes, for this proposal to advance, we'll need to take a bit of a leap of faith and assume that if we deploy a skilled BD team we can find a few legitimate use cases for this decentralized infrastructure, where ""big tech"" and ""big government"" would start to, nibble, bite, and buy.  That needs to be explored, but, lets assume for a moment it is a viable idea.

Now, to the question of ""who at Decred signs the agreement?""  Here is the proposed solution that I have in mind:  An enterprise co-development partner can announce its pledge to a decentralized project like Decred by having one of its officers prepare a public letter explaining the purpose of their ""earmarked contribution to the Treasury"" and then posting this letter to a public forum such as Reddit.  This is similar to how donors pledge funds to Universities, who, for reasons of not wanting to lose their ""not for profit status"" cannot enter into normal bilateral contractual agreements promising deliverables.  This happens all the time at Stanford and MIT, with major corporate donors making pledges to University industry affiliate programs vis-a-vis making monetary pledges via hand-signed, PDF'd, and emailed letters and following through on a voluntary basis with a wire transfer.  Since it is a public-spirited commitment, social enforcement mechanisms seem to be sufficient, and a donor who welches will be looked down upon within the social circles of the University, and will in effect become ostracized, excluded, and cut-off from the community.  Decred is creating the same ""social community"" within which social enforcement, as opposed to strict legal enforcement, can work well.

I really like the YouTube time-stamping example.  I have a friend who works in that part of Google, and I can chat with him about it.

Re the question of who does the development work?  Maybe an answer is that any proposal that would create developer load must also come with a staffing plan for who would perform the work, or else the community won't take the proposal seriously, and won't approve it?  As the community grows, hopefully we can see more contractor teams getting up to speed and bringing capacity to the ecosystem.  Is that satisfactory?

Instead it is a system where we must leverage mechanisms such as ""personal honor, pledges of commitment, and social enforcement"" if we want to ensure people follow-through on their agreements.

That might sound scary but I think it can be a lot of fun to build a society built on these principles and in some ways, a super refreshing contrast to corporate America and the legal browbeating I see everyday.  :-)

Some aspects of what you propose are already being well covered (e.g. monthly newsletter, tutorials). As the proposal doesn't mention the existing efforts I would guess you are not familiar with them.

Other aspects of the proposal just seem like a bad idea. I had a look at the Decentraland Crypto of the Month giveaway on your site at the moment. This is not something I would like to see Decred engage in, particularly the part where people earn prize draw tickets by liking/retweeting whatever you tell them to. I guess $100/month for the giveaway is just to cover admin and the prizes would be extra?

$1,000/month for ""Several weekly mentions on Youtube videos"" also doesn't sound like good value, and I wonder how that money would be spent.

2,1a367dcb91b55c60ad5fd038b219201154fcab965edd7a4639f157e409b1f4bf,1,"Hello Richard,

First of all I would like to thank you for your opinions on our proposal, since listening to the community and taking advantage of their experience is the best way to reach an approach that maximizes the benefit that the Decred project can get from the proposals that are launched. Allow me then to respond to your suggestions in the best possible way to clarify the points that we have not explained well enough and rectify those where necessary.

I would like to make clear that this is not an all or nothing, this is a proposal to the community, to make use of our environment beyond the publication of news from the sector. If part of the proposal or its totality does not conform to the needs of Decred we have no problem in retiring or rethinking it.

We are aware that Decred is already being covered by other media, as the second phase of the Ditto Communications proposal was recently approved, we simply have not seen the need to extend our proposal with information that the community already knows and that does not concern the work we are proposing to carry out.

What we are proposing is an addition to increase media coverage. Given that in the world there are almost 8 billion people, of which less than 100 million use blockchain technology or cryptocurrencies, we believe that all broadcasting work is good to promote the change, and of the thousands of existing projects, we believe that Decred It is one of the few that should be made known to the greatest number of people today.

We are sorry that the approach of the Crypto of the Month contest seems like a bad idea, but let me explain it a little more in detail so that the idea is better understood. The Crypto of the Month emerged as an idea at the beginning of this year as a disinterested initiative that would allow us to promote the few projects that in our humble opinion seem serious to us and with a value for society, beyond producing a promising product with which to enrich oneself quickly. The Crypto of the Month itself is not a contest but a series of actions that we carry out during that month to make the project known to our readers. The contest itself is a way to encourage readers to share the contest (as they get more tickets) and help more people receive the message.

Sadly we are aware that today the proportion of people interested in cryptocurrencies for noble reasons is very low, compared to those who have seen in this new market the opportunity to make easy money, but we are also aware that the latter can serve as messengers so that the message of Decred reaches those few who are interested in the change of economic paradigm that we are sure this technology is making possible. As you can see, until now the projects that have been Crypto of the Month are Grin (MW), Waves, Komodo and Decentraland. As for the actions to be carried out in the contest, these are aimed at spreading the word about them and making known both the promoted project and our media itself, given that until now all the contests of the Crypto of the Month have been disinterested and funded by ourselves.

For this contest, given that unlike the previous ones, Crypto Economy is not assuming the cost of it, we had thought that the actions to be carried out by the participants to obtain those tickets were such as:

Visit blog Decred
Follow twitter decred
Share the contest (twitter, whatsapp ..)

Let me clarify that we do not need $100 a month to carry out the contest, the total cost of the contest is $1,200 and it will be done during a single month. The cost is that because the prize we would like to give away is $1,000. The other $200 is the administration costs, social network advertising, and the fee that Gleam.io charges us. I have put a cost of $100 per month simply by dividing it by 12 months given that in the table of costs that we have added to the proposal we break down the monthly and annual costs.

Regarding the proposal of videos on youtube. After talking with the youtubers with whom we have dealings, we have come to the conclusion that the exclusive videos about a specific project do not have as much impact as the inclusion of brief spaces that talk about the project in videos of general interest, such as in a weekly news video about cryptocurrencies, the youtuber can talk for a short time about Decred, ensuring that its viewers receive the message. These youtubers are going to dedicate a time and resources to the elaboration of their videos and that is the reason why they charge us for their services. Since this is not a service that we are going to lend directly, but we will use our contacts to act as intermediaries of this with non-profit, we will be transparent in its management. However, like everything in this proposal, it is likely to be modified or removed if the community considers it appropriate.

On the last point, the one that talks about the accepted currencies, you are right, it is our custom to give facilities but in this case it is unnecessary, I am going to modify the proposal to correct this part.

I hope more members of the community will comment on their opinions as well so that we can adjust the proposal to the needs of the project and the community of Decred.

Again, thanks for your comments.",d1ebeecb239969e4623e1090137a5280b520ef115c2831f21966a26b8d6a4a6485a9a62a09b107d27223a229335c3ce53035efcd60030d1fae4432207f991602,6bf827030057fcc9fc6c8d4719dad36cd985014f9ebbf06aca10c0b152b5b406,3,c8fc6bc0f5f453c20438d18bfc0f1fd5ab418e64bf7f93a124620addfa6e4a5ee12d2bb68a7660b97066fbd5c3c4b8d81019524d855696466678399b0972be03,1560349728,0,,False,0a7f2aec-6366-43cb-bf6f-0e585d991649,cryptoeconomy,

The following is a short recap of some of the concerns I have with the proposal:

* The proposal fails to recognize that many of the suggested services already have ongoing efforts without identifying the overlap or adequately explaining the distinguishing characteristics.  This indicates to me that it is likely because the proposal author(s) is/are not actively engaged with the community and therefore is/are unaware of them.
* It appears that the proposal author(s) did not take the time to become familiar with with how payments are conducted.  I'm aware the proposal has since been edited accordingly, based on other comments, but this is very basic research that I believe should have been done prior to submitting a proposal.
* Some activities that are fairly widely known to generally not be supported by the community have been proposed without also identifying and making a case why stakeholders should change their mind.  Again, this suggests to me that the proposal author(s) seem to be out of sync with the community.
* There are multiple instances of incorrectly spelling the name.  I understand typos happen, however, in a proposal that is requesting funds in areas that specifically deal with interacting with the public, getting the name wrong, more than once, does not instill a lot of confidence.",d7bfeceecfe4b9727d56304e0e3536b7f3865c12818503f03655990a8bb68eb79aeaa02a75005e12a86284363b310a97206f107494a927db65d9975bb9b94307,937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b,6,5bf850294cc44cd7430f654de5d64bca14bcee6ff72f90b338915e2043ecf5bc4320e63eade60875bc51c10fc1b219dbd5a380b9bf133a028254ea16f24e3802,1560400108,1,1.0,False,7a982526-e44b-4ced-9924-0f4401861c05,davecgh,

The timeline and projected costs seem reasonable.

While I do think it is a good decision to separate the core functionality from the user interface (UI) aspects in this specification, I would also suggest that the contractors performing the work keep in mind the overall intended target user experience (UX), some of which was outlined by the initial DEX proposal.  To clarify what I mean, I do not consider UX and UI as the same things.  UX is about making the interfaces useful while UI is about making them look nice.  I mention this because the available message formats, response messages, and failure mode handling will have an unavoidable impact on UX.

> I had mentioned in my blog post on the topic, which I will link to in an update to the proposal, that very simple rules could be created to rate-limit trades, e.g. UTXOs used for orders must have not moved for N hours or more to be considered valid. This would greatly limit the rate at which orders can be placed by fast bots and mitigate the vast majority of known ""dark"" trading patterns. 

If you set N=24 in the above, it would mean that a valid order must be backed by a UTXO that has sat for at least 24 hours.

made it possible to automate the production of voting stats).

> I like the idea to minimize friction. Not sure if it's in conflict with the DCC, but perhaps some funds can be used to pay people ""outside"" of the barriers (which might also bootstrap them into full contractors).

I think this is worth exploring too and could be a useful approach.

In time I hope this is something the CMS will be able to support well.

It cannot be stressed enough how accurate unbiased information is critical to make good decisions. Decred's vision is that a collective of people with skin in the game can make good decisions even in areas they are not experts. In my view this vision naturally demands to have our own, self-funded, strong research department. And we are lucky to have people interested in it because it yields best results.

Early proposal charts showed us what we could not see from the numbers. Data visualization is useful in general because it allows us to utilize the well developed ""graphical"" part of our brain to quickly process information. Besides deeper insight, pretty [infographics](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/15) are good marketing material. I hope to see more data vis. Perhaps there can be a collaboration with design group that would create pretty images from the data generated by the research group.

I'm not sure if Politeia Digest and contributions to Decred Journal were/are part of research, but logically they are and should be listed among deliverables. I found the intel on what's happening in Pi and in the wider governance space very helpful to understand Decred's path. It is often just entertaining because there are so many bad ideas. But there are also things to learn from, e.g. Grin's financial transparency left a good impression.

Social media research was not too popular but I still believe it is important. I would like to see charts of various social media stats over time. Things like follower counts, activity of certain keywords, likes and more sophisticated engagement metrics - should be available to stakeholders. Preferrably with an overlay of key events like announcements and stories in tier 1 media. Maybe there is existing software for it, or [dcrextdata](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrextdata) could support it some day. Yes most (social) media is weird and biased, but it has influence and we need to be aware of it.

I like the idea to minimize friction. Not sure if it's in conflict with the DCC, but perhaps some funds can be used to pay people ""outside"" of the barriers (which might also bootstrap them into full contractors). If we think broader, as Ditto mentioned in their AMA, almost for any question you have somebody in the community knows the answer. I hope one day it is possible to organize intel provided by dozens or hundreds of people in a way that can be easily consumed by stakeholders, while all contributors are rewarded appropriately.

Automating @pi_crumbs - yes please. Ideally Politeia itself would cooperate and generate all sorts of [events](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/736) that can be fed into Matrix, Twitter, etc. I'm still often late to learn about interesting pi activity.

Re report at the end of the program - I think all proposal owners should look at Ditto's example and develop a habit of posting updates. Maybe not biweekly like Ditto, but short monthly updates would be great.

Random showerthought to exemplify what I mean by this: instead of using OP_RETURNs for dcrtime anchors, include a commitment for dcrtime's merkle root for a given period without having full nodes necessarily validate what the underlying dcrtime data is.

Not every dataset will need a commitment in the header, but those that do will necessarily become part of consensus, yes.  In order to illustrate why, consider the structure of the commitment tree and the generation process.

```
     CommitmentRoot   
      /          \
  h(c1||c2)  h(c3||c4)
    /    \     /    \
   c1    c2   c3     c4
```

Let's assume that `c1` is the GCS filter commitment, `c2` is your hypothesized dcrtime merkle root, and `c3`/`c4` are commitments to other data.

Naturally in order to generate (and later validate) the `CommitmentRoot` you need to know that values of each of those leaf nodes (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`).

`c1` would be generated by creating the filter and hashing it.  Then, that hash needs to itself be hashed with `c2` to generate the `h(c1||c2)` intermediate node and the process repeats until the root is generated.  This necessarily means that `c2` has to be known, come from somewhere, and is now committed to by consensus via the `CommitmentRoot`.  Thus, even if nodes aren't verifying the validity of `c2` itself, it is still necessarily a part of consensus.

The bigger problem though is that if `c2` can't be generated from the block data itself, that implies it must be coming from some external entity, which introduces several issues for consensus because it would no longer be self contained nor decentralized.  In other words, it would introduce reliance on one or more 3rd-party oracles which moves into the realm  of the oracle problem.

For completeness, while I know it was just an example, it's worth noting that the dcrtime Merkle roots are already completely provable because they are included in an OP_RETURN in a transaction which itself is included in a Merkle tree whose root is committed to and enforced by the `MerkleRoot`header field which every full node faithfully validates.  Moving to a non-consensus enforced proof there would actually remove the security guarantees the current system provides and therefore largely remove its utility.

Any non-consensus enforced commitments can simply be delivered by a peer-to-peer message.",95976e613135bb178d247acbe22123fbdb2a292770db875a62c5d5087e8903ed761cafac268fb4bbe0990e9b5e76abc43d3fde463c62b17a2aedfebace13f402,937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b,4,210070973a0c90a3031b0d81fcb8873fb0a000be9a2488c371ab331b9a7e68e67da87b414657c29e928034082b53566393499ff4efca0c21bade1c7757d74201,1559344300,4,4.0,False,7a982526-e44b-4ced-9924-0f4401861c05,davecgh,

Couple of things I found interesting about the bitcoin implementation.

1. There are no on-chain commitments of these filters yet, it appears the plan is to add to the filter commitment as a soft fork by tacking it into the coinbase transaction as an additional OP_RETURN.
2. OP_RETURN transactions are not part of the commitments at all, due to a circular dependency issue (the filter commitment OP_RETURN value obviously cannot reference itself in its construction). This limits some potential use cases. 

It will be really interesting to see if/how an effort soft fork Bitcoin to append the filter commitments to the coinbase transaction plays out. It may be contentious since the additional data does take up valuable block space. 

I love how Decred's ability to execute a clean hard fork makes it possible to implement the same end goal as BIP 158 in a simpler, more efficient and more useful general purpose way. It's telling how modifying the headers is not even mentioned as a possibility in any of the BIP 157/158 discussions!

As for OP_RETURN... it looks like Decred's commitments will include the entire transaction set and would therefore open up potential use cases for light clients to utilize OP_RETURN, such as those created by dcrtime, securely.

Since you brought up BIP 158, it's worth noting that dcrd includes an earlier version of GCS filters than those defined in the BIP (they were included in release v1.2.0 that was released in May 2018).  The part of this proposal that refers to introducing version 2 of the filters includes additional optimizations that have been devised since then, including those in the aforementioned BIP.

While you did hint at it by discussing the fact that putting the additional data in the coinbase would take up valuable block space and mentioning that the Decred approach outlined in this proposal is more efficient and more general purpose, I thought it might be good to make that point more explicit by calling out that the approach taken by this proposal does not take up any additional block space at all since the data gets rolled up into a single Merkle root that takes the place of the current `StakeRoot` field in the header and the existing `StakeRoot` field is folded into the `MerkleRoot` field.  This is an important consideration since increasing the amount of data that must be stored on chain is always something that must be done with great care.

In regards to `OP_RETURN` data, you're correct on all accounts.  The data will be included in the `GCSFilterRegularV2` filters, and consequently, light clients will indeed be able to securely utilize data in them as you postulate.",1d5166487975bb83009b110ae3aa0a94f96cd4cd184c09ca4428a5690c504f2a2061eb6cf03633484b239c940e90dda3e7a18a5d302ad3c4739916d8fb758300,937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b,9,e7d56761763e65291034f7e95b8ffa1ff41c9de6160131c604f776f953eaacc0456337928cdfc65e99ed9fe47e7b45853295ab69dbf588e05f738d2ef6f33105,1559553438,3,3.0,False,7a982526-e44b-4ced-9924-0f4401861c05,davecgh,

My main question is about metrics & measuring success. 

IIRC, when you were asked about metrics in the Reddit AMA, you pointed to articles published, etc. but isn't that missing something? How can we assess engagement, how effective those publications were? I know this is very tricky to quantify, but in this post you say:

> Decred’s awareness and visibility have significantly increased in the last six months, 

... as this was a fact, but how do you reckon? In the AMA you provided anecdotal examples, like your own personal experience form conferences, a personal feeling that awareness is growing,.. but as a stakeholder I'd like to see something more tangible and numerical... what metric do you think would be relevant, if any? Pageviews on decred.org? Google Trends? Exchange rate?

Or perhaps that is outside the scope of Ditto, should we direct those questions more at the marketing (Dustorf?) instead?

If awareness is growing, surely there must be some kind of measurable effect, that awareness cannot just exist in a vacuum, it needs to result in some kind of action: either Googling about it, or downloading the client, or buying the coin...? The metrics that are accessible to me do not show any significant boost in awareness, so all that remains is the anecdotal & feeling that it is growing, but how can stakeholders assess that? 

Because like you say, DCR is often not even mentioned in many articles about crypto governance, which is very strange since we should dominate this conversation, as you rightfully state. I certainly don't blame Ditto for that, but awareness obviously hasn't grown **that** much?

I'm aware Rome wasn't built in a day, but as a voting entity I need to try to find the weak/critical points, the good things speak for themselves anyway. 

You write:

> Now that it has broader awareness, 

As if this was already common knowledge agreed upon and established.
But what is the evidence for it? 

>Empower community

Yes, I especially like this part. There is potential there.
I'm thinking DCR PR&Marketing needs more out-of-the-box approaches, they have demonstrably worked in the past.

I do believe Ditto has put in a lot of hard work, and also realize that breaking everything down and reporting it is probably not a good use of resources (Decred has a similar approach, though more transparency and reporting at higher levels is being implemented). This general lack of visibility into Ditto's efforts does require a lot of trust from the community however. I would echo others comments about picking a few meaningful metrics to report on, and also ask if there's any info you can provide re: resource allocation. Ditto is a small (if growing) PR firm it appears, and presumably has other clients. It is also presumably pursuing other business in parallel with this proposal (I would hope so). These other clients will naturally compete for Ditto's internal resources, causing variations in how much the $25k/mo goes to Decred initiatives.

Within the AMA video, I love the focus, intensity, and focus on metrics.  

I appreciate seeing Decred contractors putting their full heart, soul, creativity, and passion into their work, and I ""feel"" this energy coming through in Ditto's AMA.

Hearing the level detail about what is happening, the thoughtfulness about segmenting the community, and also the focus to win that comes through in your voice gives me confidence in your commitment to the project, Liz.

Trey, your focus on Tier 1 coverage gives me reassurance that you are focussed on ""upping the game"".

+++

I am going to vote yes for phase 2, but with the following caveat:
    - I believe the $25k per month is too high relative to the Tier 1 coverage you've achieved to date 
    - as such, I believe the community needs to keep a close eye on this contract, and consider giving notice and cancelling the contract within 60 days if we do not see progress in the Tier 1 media category

+++

If I was negotiating this proposal on behalf of a private company, I would offer $10k per month base with a bonus structure for success against the KPIs, and with that structure, I'd be comfortable to let the contract run the full 6 months.

Hypothetical bonus structure: 
* $10k per Tier 1 media item, 
* $4k per Tier 2 media item, and 
* $1k per Tier 1 media item;  
This reflects the fact that a Tier 1 media item will be viewed by 10x the eyeballs of a Tier 1 media item.

+++

As a thought experiment, I wonder how hard it would it be to draw up a long list media outlets (maybe 100 to 200 or so), and to rank them into Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 categories against what we know to be Decred's vision and goals?

First, let me tell you about our approach to PR compared to other PR firms. Ditto is all about fewer accounts and more attention. At other PR firms, you could be on up to 12 accounts, many of them on your own! We do the opposite, which is why people call us the anti-PR agency. At Ditto, every account has a team. And each staffer is on no more than 4 accounts. Additionally, Trey tends to overstaff at Ditto, meaning we are staffed up for where the company will be in 3, 6, 9 months. Other PR firms tend to spread everyone thin and then desperately hire up when they get a new client. Not us! This means we are very available for Decred. 

Decred is one of Ditto’s most important clients (if not our most important client) because we truly believe in the long-term vision of the project. Talk to any one of us who work on Decred, and you’ll immediately see why that approach works and just how ingrained we’ve become. 

That’s why we’re intentionally dedicating some of Ditto’s most experienced senior talent to this account: Trey, our CEO, has been heavily involved in Decred since we started working together. It’s rare for CEOs to be involved in day-to-day client work, but Decred has been an exception from day one. Leslie is a former Forbes journalist who has written about Decred in the past, has deep knowledge of the crypto space, and specifically came to Ditto to focus on working with Decred and other crypto projects. Margaret has years of PR experience running the gamut from big tech to tech startups — and she’s become very integrated into the community. Lastly, I (Liz) am in charge of our San Francisco office, where I’m 100% focused on crypto — primarily Decred (here’s some proof: https://twitter.com/liz_bagot/status/1131305762544705536). 

I hope we’ve proven through our constant engagement in Matrix, AMAs, and interaction across various platforms, that we are available to the community 24/7. I think our results speak to that availability.",aeb2594aee77a595d5ff135f189f6d5da65bc9d764829923caf1fa2fb223bf062e9b287a59205a37e6c22bf5efae7b749df614865331153be1057a84e42cae06,c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051,19,3fe8bbbc41a3d32867adff7edb2e947ee6f800e9a42a95daed7276aea786584233684e36eac5c4a240ee5682e78da176a13d8717a03349ce48e091693c4d7202,1559252242,4,4.0,False,5ab4ff5f-0872-41f0-a2e1-af95bafe2e2a,lizbagot,

We agree we should think about how to more closely measure success. Ditto spent the first 6 months proving ourselves, and we hope we’ve shown what we can do and that we deliver on our promises. In phase 1, we stuck to the basic metric of how many stories, bylines, and tier-one coverage we generated for Decred. Anecdotally, people tell us all the time that they’re seeing Decred everywhere. Just last week, a fund that’s also a future client approached us to take a position on Decred. We at Ditto are seeing it first-hand because we’re deep in the community everyday. We’ve also talked to community members like JZ and Jake, who say they’ve noticed an uptick in awareness at conferences and meetings.

But you’re right — that doesn’t tell the whole story. 

In the first 6 months, an important metric for increased awareness was that Ditto has introduced 50+ of the leading crypto journalists to Decred. As the gatekeepers to the entire crypto community, journalists’ awareness carries immense, long-term weight, because in many cases their stories are people’s first touch point into Decred. When we first started talking to journalists at the end of 2018, the majority of them had never heard of Decred. Now, every single one of them is not only aware of Decred, but is well on the way towards associating it with staking and governance. The seeds have been planted, and we’re starting to see the results. 

Awareness is an important strategy in a bear market. Now, as things start to thaw and we prepare Decred to be in the best position possible during the bull run, what numbers should we be looking at?

In the next 6 months, there’s an opportunity to dive into more detail. Of all the metrics you mentioned, the most readily accessible is page views. Many of our clients have websites, home pages, or reports they want to drive traffic to. What are the priority web properties for Decred: Decred Journal? Decred.org? Medium page? In the proposal, we talk about creating more educational materials on the website, then getting those links placed in stories and driving traffic to those materials. One of the benefits to creating resources and making sure they’re socialized strategically is that we can measure clicks. The better and more sophisticated web presence we build, the more chances we’ll have to tie those to our PR efforts and measure web traffic. Ditto would need view access to Decred’s Google Analytics or other backend analytics so we can assess exactly how many people are clicking on backlinks in stories, which backlinks are most popular, which countries readers live in, etc. 

Other potential metrics include Twitter following, participation rates on Politeia, number of community members, number of contributors, etc. We’ve even talked about measuring awareness and sentiment at conferences. When people come to the Decred booth or approach a Decred rep, are there 3-4 questions we can ask to help us as we think about measurement and moving the needle on awareness/understanding of Decred? Metrics like these might be trickier because they’re affected by many variables besides just PR, but they could serve as long-term benchmarks. Ditto doesn’t have full visibility into all these metrics, so we would need the community’s help with gathering this information so we can measure our efforts against it over time.",1eb7302e27e230f446a2280361622856f12a92c8977eb4d7c3168d419c79de88cea5206d34ea0ced407eda3bc5eac1924e048165ef568afdd501ab6b2aa8f304,c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051,2,b37ccc5d6d64344ce40d7aeb96eac8ee67ba0b926f991a25320d0d1399644feb36079fa4340bc42438778497c966efa647683c9758899a96039100b2b046c000,1559153885,6,7.0,False,5ab4ff5f-0872-41f0-a2e1-af95bafe2e2a,lizbagot,1.0

It’s important to point out that what we do is far more than just media relations. We are writing content, doing messaging, media training, events — an interdependent web of activities that create an ecosystem of broad awareness. And we keep the community updated on our work. Media coverage is easily measurable and visible, though, so we understand comments like this. And the good news is that the additional work we’re proposing is measurable and visible, too.

Let’s hold onto those bonus incentives! It’s not something we normally do, but it’s an interesting idea. Maybe we see how the next 3-6 months go first and revisit. We like where your thinking is at, though. 

Absolutely keep a close eye on us! We like being held accountable… and being recognized when we deliver. I think you’re going to see even more amazingness from Ditto as we see a bull run coming. This is an awesome time to be working with Decred, and it’s an important time to have a PR firm that’s keeping you out there in front of your target audiences. 

You make a good point about creating a master list of media outlets we want to target. We’re glad to draw up a list and workshop it with the community, although it’ll probably be closer to 50-75 outlets, since there aren’t 100+ that cover crypto. We’ve had lots of discussions with various community members about target outlets, but we know priorities can change, and we’re happy to work off a master list that we can check off as we go. We’ve already hit important targets like WSJ, Forbes, The Block, Cheddar, etc. — lots of top tier that we didn’t expect to hit in the first 6 months. The next bull run will help us check off more on the list as outlets start covering crypto with more frequency and enthusiasm.",84031def4f2db9fccd9ca4148333facdd9beafd3b0a5d7d886c357b3763aaa32a09b4fe07a28c3bba7ffa6c08041766ac04cb25ff2d41f0c127d4e15c12c9f0a,c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051,20,b74a6872d9d6e3c06bfa0f76fe628855dca9f0ad64c7ed6f032512d0db1105ca8376e476de0f9ea2d053186f398dc04faf2d470ceabc1b40d947d3ecebaac904,1559256861,3,3.0,False,5ab4ff5f-0872-41f0-a2e1-af95bafe2e2a,lizbagot,

**However:**

The whole proposal seems to be incredibly US-centric. While I understand that Ditto is based out of the US, are there any plans to reach out to other partners/community members that reside overseas or are in non-english speaking countries? 

I love the idea of aggregating educational materials to one place, but could it be possible to extend that initiative to also include translation of that documentation in a few common languages?

This is not a problem unique to Ditto or Decred, multiple projects struggle with this. However, I think clear initiatives to create a more **global** community would be incredibly meaningful for the project. For instance, as voting is so critical to the ecosystem it seems logical to have both proposals and documentation in multiple languages. This may be beyond the scope of Ditto, but you all could ""start the conversation"".

As we fit the various pieces in place, the English language marketing is improving substantially, and this process is portable to marketing work in other jurisdictions.

It has been said that ""you go to war with the army you have"", and that is precisely what Decred is doing: using its US-based assets to increase English-language awareness about the project.  We have less assets in other jurisdictions, but we are beginning to more effectively deploy them and get results.  There is a certain amount of critical mass required to make an effective marketing push in each jurisdiction, e.g. several people who are fluent in both English and the local language that can attend events and increase awareness within their locale.  We are starting to reach critical mass for Spanish and Mandarin communities, so you can expect to see more on these fronts in the near future.",dbfcd88eba2b9ccf714c2d74744cea7994b702f6f42f7f14bfa5441316f61b71a82163e6d08bf16dfbda372744cbef44d5aa4788517e7491f33e3415b4f9530d,e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360,24,f3ab8569e98720d7692f4941dca2e4dfa65fdd919e2ec138dd3b6eb3b7ba17096fb1c6c7bbbe5c96b7dffa2a21bdf3db44474881dfc4efb72c67ab12d821440b,1559311929,3,3.0,False,fe62dd6a-2cc6-4d41-abd0-522528d33ae7,jy-p,

At a high level, I wouldn’t be surprised if we start to do a little international work for Decred later in the year. We’ve done Hong Kong for Ledger before, and since we have a London office, we are working on developing solid relations with European press and solidifying what that offering could look like.

Making sense of these numbers is hard:

* On Twitter we saw 1-2 quick rushes of new followers that were washed away with several purges of fake accounts.
* Reddit shows slow growth of subscribers, but page visits were in decline. I heard other subreddits experienced the same during the crypto winter.
* Telegram gradually declined from 4.6K to 3.6K, but it might be a good thing. I guess it also wipes bots and shills. The old bridged #telegram room was the spammies place I've ever seen.
* Facebook grew a bit from 3.1K to 3.2K.
* YouTube is almost static at 3.7K.
* Matrix stats are the most interesting to me. Not just because they show greater relative rise, but because Matrix is now the primary comm platform for those who build Decred. Those who care to join Matrix despite all UX pains (which are getting sorted btw) are the ones who look for stronger connection with Decred's contractor collective.

Before Ditto the growth was about the same, sometimes faster. But 2018 was totally different.

> Educating and empowering the community to advocate on behalf of Decred

Related idea: [Decred Ambassador certification](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/48)

> we want smart — but trusted — devs to come build on Decred.

I would add that ""trusted"" implies devs who share our values.

> We would solicit community input, develop a draft for review, present it to the community (writers channel) via Github, and then collaborate to finalize and approve.

**Questions**

> CNBC, Unconfirmed/Unchained, Bloomberg, TechCrunch, Mashable, and Fortune

Do you think it would be beneficial to prioritize outlets that have discredited themselves less? IIRC CNBC aired a video in which they showed how to [buy XRP](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/950059747771854853) (at high price?), while I don't remember anything like that from TechCrunch. Or should we just think about what is more effective? What is a good balance with ethics?

Do you have a strategy in case tech giants like Twitter, YouTube or Facebook start to openly or covertly obstruct Decred's message?

You are right that many PR firms do a ""pay for play"" placement model and, I suppose, there's no way to convince/prove that this isn't the  case.

Part of the ""skin in the game"" angle to the proposal was to demonstrate a commitment to the article delivering value to DCR, not just a mention. As I shared above, I acknowledge the rookie mistake of submitting to vote too early before getting enough feedback. Mea culpa and why I will revoke.

I thought that Politeia as an experiment was a story worth telling, which was the motivation for the proposal. The story was to help others see the potential and get motivated to participate b/c of the economic opportunity as well as the mission. 

Given the relatively low cost of this proposal and the performance model I offered, it seemed like a low risk for DCR.

Part of the problem here I think, is that in addition to general resistance to paying for content, as expressed in other comments, Decred has never been, as far as I've seen, particularly focused on engagement metrics. So there's no precedent/formula to reference. Also, content like this is typically produced by existing community members or contractors that are paid in arrears (after the article is delivered). In that arrangement, the project isn't taking on risk that the article is hidden in Forbes somewhere, or that the author will just write one article and leave the project. If you were already a contractor, it is likely you could write this article and bill the Treasury for it, perhaps against the recently approved [marketing budget](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e).",84d6cabbec983f829b3783f75616963b54293e19ca1e76687b4edd4cf96ddf1cf85934b505d26dd9f9bd04839310884f7ae68fd85dd73c1ae3cf8bff909fb608,1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73,12,7c45dcc3a9092d9d8db311236f37b53818f3e68082cf0b3648a5bac12a1448e8286b0917e501104a1f9a02ac33d36b8abc3bf3ebe539a5ec41911bb863e5330d,1557636661,0,,False,107efb48-3ab1-4830-8b69-35842ca010de,s_ben,

Mea culpa and why I will revoke....I thought that Politeia as an experiment was a story worth telling, which was the motivation for the proposal. 

Getting earlier feedback may have spared you some time if you do revoke. However, I will point out that there are people in the project that advocate for having more of this type of conversation here on Politeia, where data isn't hosted on a 3rd party and is cryptographically verifiable. So in a way the content you're writing here is kind of a free meta article about submitting a (possibly) rejected proposal, which they will appreciate; as do I, I think this is actually an interesting idea to explore and am curious to see how it plays out. A larger concern is wasting stakeholders' time when they go to review proposals that are put to vote.

It would be penny-wise and pound-foolish only if Decred is a good fit for you and you decide to pursue those future opportunities. Which you can't find out IMHO until you start to contribute.

I am of the opinion that the Contributor Experience is going to be an important part of the marketing function of any DAO. As in, how easy/difficult is it for new people to get involved and deliver value?

I'm working on a blog post about this and much of it is based upon my book, the Decentralized Marketing Organization, see here: https://bit.ly/whyDMO

One of the reasons why I hope ppl will still vote for this proposal is because I think that, to be an effective contractor for DCR, in particular, it's critical to understand the proverbial ""soup to nuts"" of a Politeia proposal...from inception to delivery.

Your initial comment highlighted a concern about a ""clear lack of understanding of how Politeia is supposed to work.""  

It is my hope that I can gain that understanding by going through the process. But the DCR payment is not just for me to learn how it is supposed to work, it is of measurable ROI to DCR b/c

Given the relatively scarcity of proposals, at the moment, it seems like a waste of stakeholders' time may not be the primary challenge right now, however, it is totally legitimate for down the road.

I guess DCR will benefit no matter what. You are right. Since I am going to write about the experience of submitting a proposal to Politeia and either getting it accepted or rejected.  So, it seems like everyone should just vote against it b/c they will get it for free, right? ;-)

I appreciate your nod to my sincerity and genuine interest in helping the cause. I suppose that is the reason why I would hope the community would vote in favor of it, because it values ppl who do want to genuinely contribute value, took the time to follow the proposal template, etc.  

It makes me think that maybe there's another avenue for would-be contributors...as in ""deliver value first, then get compensated.""

So, for example, let's say my proposal does get rejected. I blog/write an article about it anyway and it generates some traffic, interest, whatever (it would be cool to have a referral link in Decredition that could track downloads stemming from my post).  

Then, I could point to those number and either get tipped or some ""pay per download"" DCR after the fact.

Of course, there's a risk there b/c if I write an article that generates a ton of traffic (for example) and ask for some comp afterwards, the community could always decide to not pay anything.  At the same time, that would certainly dampen my enthusiasm for future work, so there's some cool game theoretics there, right?

Anyway, as you can see, I think about the broad concept of DMO/crypto-CRM (as I like to call it) a lot ;-)

I'm probably going to submit to a vote anyway, because I am curious how this process plays out. I mean, I already paid my .1 DCR (sunk cost fallacy?).

No matter what happens, I'm cool with it, because of what I've learned about Politeia, DCR, the community, and crypto-CRM/DMO.

Jeremy has written intelligently about Decred in the past and has demonstrated a knowledge and interest in the project. He's also been validated by Joel Monegro, who is a trusted member of the Decred community. This is vetting consistent with the DCC process.

He has a proven track record indicating his ability to deliver results on this proposal. The cost associated is quite modest, but more importantly, the story he's proposing to tell is of great value for Decred to communicate. Politeia is uniquely Decred, and it's the mechanism by which we as a community determine what gets funded and what doesn't. The output and the process are both important, and Jeremy's telling of the story of the process could not only get Decred more awareness and reach in a tier 1 publication, it could provide a solid impetus for additional individuals and businesses to join our community.

Furthermore, Decred is short on marketing talent and execution. We're in need of exactly what Jeremy proposes - people to see where they can contribute and jump in!

What I'm the most interested in regarding contributors to the Decred ecosystem are people who are actively engaging with the community and who can become more than one-time contractors. This proposal makes it hard to understand if you are merely doing an experiment of using politeia  or if you are genuinely interested in contributing to the project latter on.

Most actual contractors have actually taken the opposite approach : (getting involved with the community first, discussing and contributing and then taking it a step further to become a contractor.) Almost a social equivalent of doing a ""proof of work"".

There is a notable problem with the proposal, however, which is that it asks for payout in DCR, rather than USD.  I admit that I should have pressed jer979 before putting the proposal up for a vote to change this, and that is my error.  The reason we have contractors bill in USD and get paid out in DCR is that it incentivizes the right behavior: deliver work and get paid at an average monthly exchange rate versus contractors sitting on work until the exchange rate goes up.  Would you be willing to agree to bill in USD, say USD 3,000 for the entire work, with the same 40/60 split on story completion and then publication?",00261c55c7a65718d809c9d01e5b34022172693893573e88e9834c2f13096ede3698e0d95fc4bec7d07ca4254955bc9fa0ce68e36f7d813941eb62256284e705,e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360,23,72600bb24a86eaed88c83a7f741ddb372fe205a4bd9f9376eca0ca604df7df008abaa72ed980ff5c3baaa8e4e0fec6e40cdf37a99ba5c3f748c0365527925b04,1558615782,2,3.0,False,fe62dd6a-2cc6-4d41-abd0-522528d33ae7,jy-p,1.0

local groups in their countries would be much better to address marketing Decred as they would be much more conversant with the nuances of speaking to their audiences

NIgeria , South Africa and Kenya would likely be the best starting point for English , though if we have good french translations of all our information there is a wider swathe of francophone countries to address

GEorgePro's proposal seemed to be a bit expensive and seemed to be a bit opportunistic given his seeming involvement in dash

I would think for the price quoted for jer979's proposal a lot more could be achieved by groups in african countries and if groups would demonstrate some initative and produce some articles that were published in respective news sites then I would be likely to vote yes is they then submitted a proposal similar to this one

if we have not got people involved in decred in African countries , then maybe some research to find crypto groups and try to encourage them to look at decred and then want to market it

NIgeria seems to have a solid Decred group already and maybe they should be tapped for ideas.

Definitely for contractors based in USA, who may be trying to live off of their DCR earnings, I can see that they might want to earn a USD-indexed salary.

However, I'm not sure it would be a good idea to make this a general policy.  

Here are a few edge cases for your consideration:

 -- What if the contractor lives in Tokyo or Geneva, and their cost of living is indexed to Japanese Yen or Swiss Frank and not to USD, and they truly are trying to match their salary with their expenses, to avoid mismatches?

 -- What if a contractor is a superstar, and through one proposal they can double the value of the Decred economy? Shouldn't they be allowed to propose to be paid a DCR lump sum, and if they really deliver a big win for the community, then they can participate in a fully-aligned way in the value they've just created?  

  -- What if in the future a contractor wants to live as a true Decred citizen, earning Decred, running a business within the Decred economy, and spending Decred.  I know it's still a ways around the corner, but wouldn't we generally want to encourage citizens of this new ""digital sovereign"" to index earning, hiring, saving, and spending in DCR terms?

Based on these observations, I would propose that a contractor be permitted to choose if they'd like to be paid out in:

(b) top-10 international fiat currency indexed rate, or 

(c), straight DCR payment if/when that their preference.",a2e0a2cd7a3935564e9b87f4a877e1175c54b5840080f2fa9f86eee8650ec638d7b18a149510a06433fa389cba5ebc031f68a059ddf9546de4f15b4da1f19509,dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079,28,47606b118ceb7488b03ab9d27302b2adc3d67d7a074996a55031e93cee5b30abef59649aa1e5ff6b758a8477cc48253ecba18ac837ebe419bd5c88b89a322004,1558667336,1,2.0,False,0b4b0bb2-e406-40e2-9d08-8b6711fefb18,betterfuture,1.0

He implies in his proposal that both of these publications are Tier 1 publications. which is not true. 



The precedent this sets is saddening. I'm rather disappointed in the Decred electorate, I thought they we were smarter then this kind of bs.

For one, no proposal will double the value of the Decred economy. Barring some miracle (Decred Jesus, are you listening?). You seem to be eluding to paying in arrears (i.e. getting paid only for what you've already done)? That is the way the contractor system works now, but hourly. You're suggesting a performance element. Introducing performance pay is interesting, but presents risk. Especially for marketing tasks. How do you measure the impact of any one action to the ""Decred economy""? In the modern surveillance capitalism model, you can actually measure this for things like e-commerce.

While we're still a long way from this for Bitcoin even, the number of merchants does steadily grow. A true die hard could probably survive spending only DCR. This is unrealistic for most contributors for some time though. But something to be encouraged generally.

As for your suggestions for different forms of payment, I agree there is room for experimentation. The current model (USD-indexed rate) has strong support among ""leadership"" and much of the community, because exposing contractors to the volatility of DCR increases their skin-in-the-game, or some such Talebism.

> For one, no proposal will double the value of the Decred economy.

I understand it is unlikely for a project that is incremental in nature, and focussed on technology enhancement. 

That said, for announcing a successful BD project, it might be attainable.  As an example, when Trusted IoT Alliance announced it would partner with the Quantum blockchain project, the value of the Qtum token economy nearly doubled overnight.  

Lots of times when a small cap company announces an initial major BD deal, the price of the stock will double.  I know DCR is not a stock, but the principle can still apply.

How might this happen for Decred?  What about a proposal from a big systems integration company to integrate a voting app for a particular country's upcoming national election with dcrtime, to time-stamp all of the voting events to Decred's blockchain?

> You're suggesting a performance element. 

In the example above, if the proposal from the systems integration company was to be paid 15,000 DCR lump sum, and the price of the token did double as a result of a successful implementation, it would certainly be a nice reward for the systems integration company to participate in the doubling of the value in USD terms of their 15,000 DCR .  Thus, by being paid in DCR, they are fully aligned with the value they are creating for the economy.  Does that make sense?",72fcf25df8c7a12c029085c4d59366a7f37fa3b212944b89e7ade3305b0e5fd165e3308e385314b9145cd196a6a1ccc0acb6d25943c9a495c201aa8e4e5f030c,dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079,35,a3c2f6bdc3a3cb74f3fa4368e76e952ecc35bd6d1488d2edab5c492aebbde17f1ed7f99e52666df2aa14e6366b11551c95bbefb8bf46b403a3c85110e34d9d03,1558790562,1,1.0,False,0b4b0bb2-e406-40e2-9d08-8b6711fefb18,betterfuture,

Something I have seen while overseeing contractor billing is that things like exchange rates and how those rates are calculated can figure heavily into contractors' behavior.

Billing in DCR creates incentives that do not align well with delivering work in a timely fashion.  If a contractor thinks the exchange rate will go up in the near future and their invoices are denominated in DCR, they are incentivized to sit on their work and not complete it right away.  On the other hand, if the exchange rate is in a downtrend, they are incentivized to hurry and deliver their work product sooner, possibly sacrificing quality in the interest of getting paid out sooner.

Similarly, how exchange rates are calculated matters in the context of incentives.  If you use a spot exchange rate, contractors are incentivized to try to manipulate the exchange rate to receive a better payout, so we use the average of the exchange rate over the entire month a contractor bills for.

From the perspective of avoiding complexity, it does not make sense to accommodate arbitrary payout terms.  The only reason we have been able to build the infrastructure we have is that we have been strategic about adding complexity.  It is incredibly easy to add too much complexity and turn a simple matter, e.g. billing for work, into a rathole.",3e1833148f3fc1dbc45b0839d2864750d744513ff26eafc83f8a2f80abfa542b8fc6629c31f4c80e16e2ca2237274b21ef7b7b67ec9f96cfb6d508b7582c0e00,e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360,36,67ff3548377bec7a8d1c597d1c79fc5092829f6548268db6c8f89d7fb6d6c7114bd0295451b093dbb5e96b80fe4b23da6275f06a932525663ef0fcbe6f032e04,1558809324,3,3.0,False,fe62dd6a-2cc6-4d41-abd0-522528d33ae7,jy-p,

As I am sure you know from your own experience, there are two sides to every story and there are parts of the story about IOTA that are not public. 

I saw no reason to publish them because it would, I believed, only make things worse getting into a public discussion about what happened, even though I knew I would have to deal with the legacy of a Reddit hit page on me. 

In hindsight, there are plenty of things I could have done differently, but such is life.

I am sorry you have never heard of VentureBeat.  Within the early adopter tech community, I would make the argument that it's a relatively well respected source and has readers who are more likely than average to explore DCR (either now or in the future).

I had priced in DCR primarily b/c I wanted to think ""crypto-first"" or ""decred-first.""

If DCR is to be a currency that ppl use, then it should be thought of as a Unit of Account. The Treasury is measured in DCR so my thinking was that the proposal could be thought of as ""percentage of treasury"" instead of having ppl do a conversion in my head.

It would be cool if a contractor could get paid into a wallet that they controlled, but had ""HODL/stake by default"" so that s/he had to stay aligned for the long-term.

It just struck me as weird to ask for USD when the whole point of DCR is to get ppl to use it. To me, that starts with thinking in terms of DCR as a currency natively.

I would do whatever ppl want in terms of payment, since for me, this is less about the money and more about the opportunity to learn about working with DCR community, evangelize the unique idea of Politeia, and demonstrate some value (hopefully).

You raise a great point:

Can it be both?

I mean...I am doing an experiment which is ""what is it like to write a proposal for a DAO and then have to deliver against it?""

As I hope you can tell from the proposal, the various blog posts, and the engagement here as well as on Twitter, I have already spent time with the community and opened up a number of new areas for exploration (CX, payment in DCR, etc.)  Not that I'm a genius or anything, but there's already been some value delivered merely through how I've approached the process. 

See Luke's tweet, for example:

https://twitter.com/lukebp_/status/1131544948996792320

So, and this was the thrust of the CX post, let's say I put forth a proposal and ppl attack me personally and make me feel like I'm an idiot. Well, that's not a community that I want to be a part of long-term.

At the same time, what if I put forth a proposal and there's a rigorous ""intellectual fight club"" atmosphere through which the proposal gets better, we get to know each other, value is delivered, and ppl are respectful but determined. That IS a community I would like to join.

So, in some respects, the proposal is like a ""date.""  Does DCR like me and do I like DCR...enough so that we want to be long-term partners?

My hypothesis is that, at scale, there will be many, many more ppl like me who say ""hey, I'd like to give DCR a try by making a thoughtful proposal"" and their experience will help shape long-term commitment.

Also, and maybe this is where I slightly disagree with the prevailing community sentiment (which is fine), is that I believe there could be multiple paths towards becoming a valuable contributor as well as multiple paths towards identifying valuable contributors.

That makes sense in principle, but afaik, there's no formal mechanism for the community to decide what's ""big enough"" after the fact. So that might need to be defined in the proposal. Perhaps there is some metric that can be used to define big enough? Or, perhaps it's not a binary, but a multiplier? E.g. pay is 40 DCR + A*60 DCR, where A is some measure normalized to btw 0-1?

""Single article"" relationships rarely work out well for the client. 

To provide great results, a PR agency needs to get to know its client very well, and this takes several weeks (like in the case with Ditto PR).

Furthermore, oftentimes when a PR agency sells coverage on a ""per article basis"", this is achieved through deals with journalists that paid to obtain a contributor account.

First of all thanks for the proposal submission. Frankly speaking, i have not heard of your exchange before, but from a very brief glance and short look up on google, it does seems that your exchange is as legit as it can be, and has been around for 5-6 years awith  a healthy amount of users base on the active users in the ""trollbox"". How many of those of those are legit however, remain in question.

I am however, very intrigued by your proposal because you are the first to offer a basket of lesser common currencies pairing, namely RUB like you mentioned. 

My qeuestion:

1. Have you had any breach in security of your exchange in the past 5 years of operation? (regardless of minor or a major one). Please be honest.
2. I see that you offer up to 6 different currencies pairing in your exchange, so in the case of decred, why stop at 2? Are you able to make all 6 fiat pairing available on the outset? 
3. Is your $20,000 budget a one time fee to cover all deliverable, namely future maintenance/tech support, or will there be an ongoing charges?
4. Could you elaborate more on the CryptoDealers side of deal? What kind of marketing events, how long will the promotional activities will last?
5. From what i understand, if this proposal goes through, all it takes is 5 working days from start to finish and open for traders to start trading. Is that right?
6. If successfully implemented, will there be any plan for promotional activities on your exchange (i.e: zero fee trading, competition with rewards given based on trading volume, etc etc) to encourage the initial take-up rate? If so, will this be part of this proposal budget?

That's all i can think of at the moment. =)",92454052b7cac9088c6999ee596a7403de774ad6ae3db4deb33a66f77dafcfec4e30b817872aa810d4e42a23fefdd5fb7880c678ffd1610e7319b78ed306bf03,88274f3fb81b459ac4db997ce32c1ee79ed77c62ed29b5dbd4b7ef4cfad6eaf1,1,7cf0010c3476c8ec4e4e2a9422e4da6b6f79c4643f83767b23108b8d2a6fc40d9d31a38d1c8c9c707ce149ac0b29812f471a249b1bf3e91e8bd52b6782698103,1554223703,4,4.0,False,9af99901-60ab-4bff-8080-6eb44f5692e1,gravityz3r0,

**Liked**

* Handling of the [pre-proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/b0y9le/integration_on_exmo_exchange_new_fiat_pairs/) on Reddit.
* I trust DZ's feedback.
* Expansion into new regions and fiat pairs is important.

**Notes**

> quality assets over quantity

I would appreciate if someone could vouch that all [listed](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/exmo/) assets are quality.

> promo video, YouTube marketing, events

If any promo expenses are included in the proposal I suggest to remove them, focus this proposal on the integration and handle promotion separately (via either separate proposal or via the marketing 2019 budget).

**Concerns**

Social media activity feels artificial. Of course fundamentally what matters is that EXMO provides a decent exchange service to their clients, but still that's a minor concern.

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXMO_Official/new/). Nice to see so many upvotes for a 6K sub. It suggests much higher engagement compared to our r/decred where 9K subscribers leave 2-4X less upvotes. But why so few comments? For example, [86 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXMO_Official/comments/adudo5/a_place_under_the_new_year_tree_what_to_expect/) and zero comments? The only post with many comments is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXMO_Official/comments/ad8pxg/how_to_trade_crypto_when_the_market_is_off/edetzk7/), where half the comments are actually criticism and the _only_ account that came to defend is now [suspended](https://www.reddit.com/user/ketschup72/). Now the [poster](https://www.reddit.com/user/ugoyyacjvfrz/) account of that highly upvoted thread is gone, and the thread is delisted from the sub.
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Exmo_Com): Content done profesionally, although [begging](https://twitter.com/Exmo_Com/status/1102964806095683584) for medium claps is lame.
* I'm not a fan of [trading contests](https://exmo.com/en/news_view?id=2685) or [facilitating ICOs](https://exmo.com/en/news_view?id=2667).

**Questions**

> EXMO Finance LLP is the largest exchange in Eastern Europe in volume and liquidity.

Is there an independend report to support this claim?

Did all of the listed coins pay the same $24K? For example, did Dash pay for the [listing](https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/dash-on-exmo.8102/)?

> covering losses while adding to the listing (offline for 4 hours)

To be fair, this triggers me. Why Decred should pay for _your_ 4h downtime?

> Technical consultation/ listing support may be requested if needed.

Our dev hours are precious. Since we carefully count all expenses now, will _you_ pay Decred for technical consultation?

What are your thoughts about recent research on fake volume on most exchanges? Does EXMO engage in such activities?

> Verification is not required (trade crypto/crypto)

1. Is there an independend report to support this claim?
**For example, you can check coinhills - most traded national currencies to BTC  https://www.coinhills.com/market/btc-rub/

- This is one of the proofs that the trading volume is not faked 
We have won a couple of rewards such as the best exchanger in CIS 2017 and 2018 (according to the Forklog magazine) Blockchain life and many others, definitely, you can easily google it.**
2. Did all of the listed coins pay the same $24K? For example, did Dash pay for the listing?
**No, our listing fee is way bigger, for DCR as I have mentioned it is only the reimbursement of listing expenses, regarding Dash (we have listed this coin long time ago from the early beginning when it was even Dark coin) or other coins listed on EXMO - unfortunately, information cannot be disclosed.    **
3. To be fair, this triggers me. Why Decred should pay for your 4h downtime?
**It is not a secret that all activities related to listing such as technical integration, platform maintenance, further DCR maintenance, and tech support, others have its cost we have divided this between two partners Decred and EXMO**
4. Our dev hours are precious. Since we carefully count all expenses now, will you pay Decred for technical consultation?
**Unfortunately, no, but if Decred can provide us integration manual for an exchanger we won't take a lot of time from DCR devs **

5. What are your thoughts about recent research on fake volume on most exchanges? Does EXMO engage in such activities?
**I have already provided a link to one of the similar resources, you can compare our trading volume for example with our web site visiting by yourself it is not very hard and make sure that we have an organic volume, the second case, from our latest activities you can watch how we held the first IEO in Eastern Europe – fully organic, 800 participants, 99 seconds**

Lets get this vote across the line in the affirmative.  The demand increase for DCR in Eastern Europe should pay for the cost outlay multiple times over.

1.	Have you had any breach in security of your exchange in the past 5 years of operation? (regardless of minor or a major one). Please be honest.
**There was one issue in 2017 but it is not regarding customers funds and technical security. One of our team members were  kidnapped in Kyiv, Ukraine, but we have solved this ASAP everything is ok with him   **
2.	I see that you offer up to 6 different currencies pairing in your exchange, so in the case of decred, why stop at 2? Are you able to make all 6 fiat pairing available on the outset?
**Yep, you are right and we are planning to add one more - GBP. 
We have an idea to expand Decred to the Eastern Europe market where we are one of the best so definitely, local Ukrainian fiat, as well as RF, will be the best.  After adding DCR to our listing in a couple of months we will discuss the possibility to increase the number of pairs**
3.	Is your $20,000 budget a one time fee to cover all deliverable, namely future maintenance/tech support, or will there be an ongoing charges?
**Yes, one-time fee, without any maintenance fee, etc  **
4.	Could you elaborate more on the CryptoDealers side of deal? What kind of marketing events, how long will the promotional activities will last?
**As far as I know, there will be 3-4 meetups CryptoDealers - Decred representatives - EXMO
Kyiv, Moskow, Tbilisi maybe St. Petersburg. Definitly we will provide a roadmap and more info after getting an aproval with the listing question **
5.	From what I understand, if this proposal goes through, all it takes is 5 working days from start to finish and open for traders to start trading. Is that right?
**The timeline has been provided approximately (+-2 days)**
1.	If successfully implemented, will there be any plan for promotional activities on your exchange (i.e: zero fee trading, competition with rewards given based on trading volume, etc etc) to encourage the initial take-up rate? If so, will this be part of this proposal budget?

This purpose of this project is to understand and track the activity on Politeia. A better understanding of how the proposals site is being used will inform the interpretation of its outputs and decisions about how Pi is developed.

#### Products

- Processed data from Politeia, and code to do the processing, available to all in accessible forms
- Reproducible analyses, statistics and charts
- Write-ups that offer interpretation of the data

This [repository](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/pi-research) has been created to organize and track the work and its readme has a more complete description of what this will involve, plus some ideas for analysis and early work on a few aspects.

Crytpocurrency news outlets frequently report on merchants who have recently started to accept bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as payment for their goods/services in countries such as Venezuela (1) and it appears as though this is one of the most compelling use cases for cryptocurrencies to facilitate payments.

Decred is likely to be well suited as an exchange medium or form of payment for goods and services given its transaction fees, mobile wallet support and transaction times. 

The aim of this research is to investigate the following:
(i) how, why and in what way are cryptocurrencies currently used in countries such as Venezuela (or others with an unstable fiat currency)
(ii) is there an opportunity for Decred usage to increase in any such countries?
(iii) If so, what does Decred need in order to increase its usage?

Suggested lines of inquiry:
- What is the prevelance of cryptocurrency as a payment method in countries with unstable currencies and macroeconomic indicators
- In which sectors/industries are merchants most likely to accept cryptocurrency for payment
- What are the most popular ways in which consumers acquire cryptocurrency?
- What are the most popular services merchants use to accept crypto?
- For how long do they hold crypto before converting to fiat and which fiat currencies do they tend to convert into?

Who are these _potential users_? Well, I think that's something we should consider first in some depth. Who do we think could benefit from dcrtime? What kind of uses would we like to promote?

If we know who the potential users are, we could come up with a methodology that involves reaching out to those groups in some way, making them aware of dcrtime and what it can do - and _then_ asking our questions about whether they're interested and what the likely impediments would be.

Collect and evaluate coverage of Decred in ""the media"". This research can inform us about how Decred performs in the press and whether we should adjust our outreach/marketing efforts. This is different from _social media research_ proposed in another comment.

A prototype of a building block for this already exists: [decred-media-tracker](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/decred-media-tracker) -- a collaboratively maintained dataset of links to Decred coverage along with some metadata. Some examples of what it makes possible:

* statistics
  * how many pieces of content are generated per week/month
  * which domains and authors post more or less about Decred
  * stats for countries and languages
* deeper analysis from following the links (some can be automated):
  * assess quality of content, including factual errors
  * categorize the subject of the article
  * analyze the keywords/SEO
  * use techniques like sentiment analysis or topic modeling
* independent researchers can build on top of it

I'm not sure how viable this idea is but it strikes me that Decred is unique in that it has a POS layer in which funds are functionally ""locked up"" in exchange for a voting right. If the locked up funds could be 'used' somehow to provide additional 'features' such as privacy in addition to securing the right to vote, a win-win situation could be achieved.

The research question is thus: Is it possible to increase the role of staked funds such that ""locked"" funds can increase the privacy of Decred (e.g using a 'coin join' technique or something else novel).",4369911c9e910f6700afd7968f3721b93515d5faa9f5e2d025177c2092e25ae5cf470ab487d14ffb474506558a423ea0c23d867fd744aa735754af84f30d8e07,5d5565d8b11a0357e19c021bcb67177e43c8eb655e4037bdfd8dc9489fc71c45,19,ea82eab85cdfeabc208d7a2757896f0c27588eba14f7f1c2c81714b37f06abd659d418684f5db826d4072ca54a156c53e11913f281d762059ef689b187dc8106,1543550940,-1,,False,87a84587-902c-4535-96c7-c92784c7167e,lewildbeast,1.0

The purpose of this project is to understand how social media coverage of cryptocurrencies works, and how Decred is performing relative to its peers. 

Platforms like reddit and twitter seem to be quite influential in the cryptocurrency space, but it can be difficult to understand how they work in practice. 

This project would be about collecting data from a set of platforms and using it to address questions of interest.

Platforms:

- Reddit - data from reddit is easy to access, I have already [started](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/analysis/blob/master/reddit/reddit1.md) to [explore](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/analysis/blob/master/reddit/readme.md) what kind of analysis is useful.
- Twitter - data is harder to access and collect. I would be interested in seeing network analysis of who follows/likes/re-tweets who, and what the components of the network look like.
- GitHub - not exactly social media but has some of the same features and is quite amenable to detailed analysis. @degeri is already [working on](https://github.com/degeri/decred_contributor_track) a way to identify first-time Decred contributors automatically through GitHub for the Journal.

The purpose would be addressing questions like:

- How do different projects use the same platform? What kind of value do they gain from the platform? Is there anything Decred can learn from their approach?
- Is it possible to identify attempts at manipulating or gaming the platform? 

I have created a [repository](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/analysis/) with exploratory work on reddit, it would probably make sense to start new repositories for research on other platforms.",09b889982f4cbf826f89e68f0d761c6a8004ba1cfe57491690656e5de295b0b42307321faadd0dcebf343ba105089913b3fe4279a92e7f5c0c73960a93937d03,cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e,2,378f778b75c96a64089b72331313242e25dd156a1f7680abb1dd017143fcb8e5abe49590410f182ef9906af4980ae7d97e12d7728d8cc98a6974b45fb2f53d0f,1543271615,4,6.0,False,350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c,richard-red,2.0

Specifically with regard to **governance**, if this is truly decentralized and permissionless we should be able to identify open public spaces and fora for each project where deliberation is occurring and decisions are being made. Without such spaces where outsiders can follow and understand decision-making, there is a significant barrier between those on the inside making the decisions, and those on the outside. In that case the best that insiders can hope to do is to accurately interpret the needs of the other stakeholders and act in a way they think is fair.

In my view building a successful cryptocurrency movement requires acquainting many more people with the fundamentals the technology. Only on this basis can people act as effective guardians of the networks. The best way to achieve this is with a role people can productively play, and incentives!

Decred's approach is excellent in this regard:

- Granting stakeholders a quantifiable say in decision-making that cuts across every aspect of the project through both the on-chain consensus voting and Politeia proposals
- Incentivising participation with voting rewards, for ticket voters.
- Incentivising participation with treasury funds, for contributors who work on the project and generate value for the project and space

Any project that wants to be resistant to social attacks should be pursuing the same kinds of aims. I think it would be very worthwhile to track where all of this activity is happening in the space and start developing a better collective view on what is going on.

For projects where it is not possible to identify such open public spaces, and where ""the team"" are effectively walled off from the community by handlers - that would probably signify more of a centralized/hierarchical/corporate production model. 

I have been thinking about how to build a resource like this, and I hope to put together a prototype for what that could look like in the not too distant future. I think the whole space could benefit from a clear overview of the attributes of each project, the tradeoffs being made, and links to key venues or sources.

I see the social media analysis suggested here as a starting point, the data is quite easily accessible and standardized between projects, so makes for an easy entry-point to understanding some aspects of the  communities and how they organize (or don't).",0d707cf6a8f805f4b0ee6b7f1e28eba325de7d8b96a6af6fc23f0741b766e300b63bd81acfd0a8861afaf1a6aa855a4dcae65bc7e3f311652b0d530cdbe3be08,cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e,3,ab6aee356bc9d9579348bc914e2a727df0dc76db0816b12f531f7a01621f06d027625f803e2948cc0ac7df442f87d81a4969b6e902f806f03af972893bab9106,1543272531,3,3.0,False,350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c,richard-red,

This would greatly expand Decred's initial airdrop idea. The main question is the economics of it. My bet is that the gained network effect would cancel / outweight the negative effects of people dumping the airdropped coins.

1. Deleterious to network effects of nascent currencies wrt Metcalfe or (much better IMO) transactome-informed network capital theory (see Gogerty's work) 
2. A/B testing of different technical, economic or philosophical approaches (""let the market decide"")
3. An inevitability of entropy and/or finite social scalability as these networks grow and mature it is difficult to keep all stakeholders sufficiently aligned for optimal network health.

As such, protocol-layer fork resistance and effective public fora with voting mechanisms can certainly be helpful tools, but I suppose there is a question as to whether the so-called tyranny of the majority should be exercised in all cases. If there was a ""block size"" style civil war in Decred with no acceptable compromise in sight, is the status quo still the best situation in all cases?

Disclaimer: I have an ongoing research project studying forks from a variety of perspectives and Decred's fork-resistance got a nod in the manuscript. Going to revisit it again soon. So I am biased :)

It is a rather nuanced topic but I will hopefully be able to precis it here.

As part of my investigations on the above topic [http://asymmetries.pllel.com], I have been involved as a ""Pollinator"" in the DAO Stack Alchemy Genesis AlphaDAO - their semi-centralised testing bed. As part of this some erstwhile collaborators who are ""DAO & Governance"" specialists are part of a unit funded by the GenesisDAO named the ""Accountability Task Force (ATF). See us on a panel at the Web3 Summit Hackerspace here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AipPErp0UM0]

As this DAO is funded by, allocates funds to successful proposals AND pays them natively in ETH with no indexing or mitigation for cryptoasset price voltatility. This is obviously in contrast to what happens in Decred, with DCR being the payment method via treasury but with nominal cashflows being indexed to USD value.

Due to the rather pronounced decline in the fiat price of cryptoassets recently, the latest and supposedly final proposal to continue funding the ATF for 2 more months at a cost of 50 ETH has created a huge amount of contention and debate. People asking for it to be rescinded (mainnet on-chain so not possible), others downvoting including head of DAOStack Matan Field, others asking for more accountability on funding spend, yet others asking for refund. IMO many people still have last winter's prices in their heads. Personally, I voted for it, to see the resolution of the experiment, and because I don't consider ETH to be a monetary asset or have a long-term value proposition.

What is really fascinating is that part of the ATF's remit is to map out social attack vectors in DAOs, and people started to ask if this was a simulated attack :) They said no, and I genuinely believe it not to be, but who can say. 

It somewhat leads to the notion that DAOs and ""human governance"" are at odds with each other. I also had a front-row seat for that other DAO (TheDAO) having been a token holder. I am super interested to see how things work out here and have been passing on tips to the GenesisDAO reflecting some of the best practises I see in Decred - for example suggesting pricing / payout of proposals in DAI rather than ETH.

Visions and potentials for how dcrtime and Politeia have been shared.

We are using Politeia and dcrtime and it works great.  The success should be viewed like the Mars landing.

2. What do business integration companies working with other products today want that has not been built out (specifications? documentation? technical briefs? media/materials?)?

Politeia proposals have different requirements to rule change proposals, and determine the tickets which are eligible to vote through a snapshot of the ticket pool at a specific block height, as opposed to the rolling sortition of on chain voting. It is possible that a Politeia proposal to update the constitution might fail despite a successful on chain vote and the changes being activated.

I have three technical concerns:

1. As others have mentioned, the fact that a vetoed treasury spend on chain delays that entire month's payouts is concerning. Contractors shouldn't be stuck waiting to get paid over contention with a single line item in the spend tx. I would much prefer an output-by-output on-chain approval.
1. What happens if there is a genuine mistake on the part of the Pi operators in creating the on-chain tx? Would this would be resolved by voting down the entire tx, and trying again next month (possibly running us up to the 150% accrued value limit for the next month)?
1. There is a limit of one OP_TSPEND per 28 days (8064 blocks). What if there's a drop in hashpower, making 8064 blocks take more than a month to produce? This could result in late payments and disgruntled contractors.",6ed275a45d7d4f4000535152d4fc1628ec599fb2d9873b244e2f1e1ea0bdcc885049abefef41538fa070fa8b3198cc5af8d4a415d8b9ed509ef7641369d22509,1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106,12,dafb49ac06c888235c4fb9833b30b51f4560d65aecfb7dcdd797b53404de3f4da3e461d22dc2c6d5ab6952223963b1a75e4a261ffa0245a7e3280d68a830b50d,1554332543,3,3.0,False,8b7137f1-bb9e-46a3-bb20-f9750863aeec,ryanzim,

2. Yes, that is correct.  There would be a permanent vote bit assigned to voting on a treasury spend in the same way that there is a bit voting for the disapproval of the previous block.   There would be additional `OP_RETURN` data added that specifies the hash of the transaction that is being voted on in the same way that the block that is being voted on is included via that mechanism.  Then there would be separate consensus rules that enforce the spending limits.  That would theoretically allow the potential to spend more than once from the treasury in the future with a voted consensus change as well as allow immediately publishing an amended treasury spend since failure to get enough votes on the initial spend would effectively invalidate the old draft transaction.  These are the types of specific details that would be in the DCP.


3.  Yes, the proposal should have specified a signature there.

In regards to your questions regarding p2sh in terms of key compromise, it would just move the problem into the p2sh instead of the output of the coinbase because the script itself has to be consensus enforced, as you noted, so there would have to be a vote to change the script too.

Something I think the proposal does not do a good job of explaining is that `OP_TGEN` and `OP_TSPEND` create what is effectively an account for the treasury instead of using the standard utxo model.  The draft key signature also would not have the power to unilaterally spend as `OP_TSPEND` would require both a signature from that key as well as the tally of the yes votes from stakeholders, which acts as an efficient proxy for all of their signatures, to succeed.  That approach also cleanly solves the issue where you would have a bunch of tiny inputs (one per block) in large treasury payouts resulting in massive transactions that would violate size limits.  The outputs of the spending transaction itself can spend to an valid script as usual.


4. There isn't much to show since it would consist of exactly one opcode, named `OP_TGEN'.

A current coinbase looks like:
```
out[0] = <OP_HASH160 <current treasury script hash> OP_EQUAL>
out[1] = <OP_RETURN 4e1305004fdcced262afa8dc>
out[2] = <OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <miner pubkey hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG>
```

A new coinbase under this proposal would look like:
```
out[0] = <OP_TGEN>
out[1] = <OP_RETURN 4e1305004fdcced262afa8dc>
out[2] = <OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <miner pubkey hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG>
```

It requires consensus enforcement of only being valid in the very specific case of the first output of a coinbase transaction and that script being required to be exactly `OP_TGEN`.

5. That wouldn't work because a transaction is either valid or it's not.  There is no notion of partially-valid transactions.  The draft transaction is called that in the proposal because that is what it really would be.  It would remain off chain, but publicly available, and would fail validation until all spending conditions were met, namely the new semantics enforced by `OP_TSPEND`.  The result is that if anyone tried to broadcast it before it's valid, it would be rejected, and once it became valid, anyone could broadcast it independently of the Pi operators.  That is also why the votes must include the hash of the spending transaction they are voting on.",32149739bb5d5014210c1a7302dbb69a3ec87d32b963abe7401737e120367af2e263ba62fa9a3b25327044bad94c8faa6565b921e6741fdecc3ace470451e00f,937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b,13,9577a0995795ff78296bf7c2a90aa11fe42f22a7e381747b16327712d166abdaf5f4c51f444eb72ccf8b87e5e7b2d764490b1ea8e104061901a3510bcf093901,1554361249,3,3.0,False,7a982526-e44b-4ced-9924-0f4401861c05,davecgh,

It's a fair concern, but from a technical perspective, there is no notion of partially-valid transactions and attempting to allow that would open a massive can of worms for not only these transactions, but all transactions.  Thus, an output-by-output on-chain approval would effectively require stakeholders having to vote on hundreds or thousands of individual transactions every month which does not seem very reasonable burden to impose.

2. There would be no need to wait a month.  If there were a legitimate problem with the transaction, the draft would simply be scrapped and new draft created.  Quoted what I replied with in a separate comment:

> The draft transaction is called that in the proposal because that is what it really would be. It would remain off chain, but publicly available, and would fail validation until all spending conditions were met, namely the new semantics enforced by `OP_TSPEND`.

That is also why the votes must include the hash of the spending transaction they are voting on.

3. Allowing more than one (but a small number such as perhaps 2 of 3 to prevent attempts at abuse and burdening the stakeholders) per period so long as the sum of the amounts does not exceed the imposed spending limits seems prudent.  It's worth noting though that a drop in hash power would potentially delay payouts regardless of there being a limit.  However, it is true that only allowing 1 per fixed period of blocks could potentially result in slowly pushing the payment date forward if there is loss in hash power that is not eventually offset by an equivalent gain.",b079b9bc1c8625d31653a634c8f01c89e7718e111ec990d10e49203101d5945d1ea84251b0153465e726f76684613f03f1b86bc1cdca97c3abb670aa0fff560f,937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b,14,7827897ae5b7ace7911f3902cf6d50955ed870a94b6379feb700cbfc0a7126f055691319ab12c56de201788f57ce9263f3c25e4683d596d5fc63a46c46423a09,1554363849,3,3.0,False,7a982526-e44b-4ced-9924-0f4401861c05,davecgh,

Ah ok, that makes more sense now.

I assumed the tx would be voted on _after_ being broadcasted and mined, but if it's before (and the votes are carrying the hash of the future valid tx) then I believe corrections for contentious payments can be issued faster: within the first (say) 24h of voting, if it's clear that a particular payment is receiving too many ""no"" votes, just generate a new one and start voting on _that_. Whichever tx is approved with the highest margin within the 2016 block window is considered valid, all others are not.

On the one hand, introducing an account semantics for the treasury definitely improves scalability and usability (by reducing the utxo set, removing the need for largish payment txs as you said, easier tracking by adding the balance to a header commitment, etc) so that's a nice positive.

Sorry I don't follow how does it work. Once the pi draft key is included in consensus as the one that can craft the draft tx, the only two options to ""distrust"" it are 1) voting No for tx singed with it, or 2) voting to change consensus again to use another key. If clients are locally configured to ""distrust"" the draft key, what does it influence?

I thought similar. If voters can specify line items they don't like when casting No vote, this could reduce the amount of back and forth when disputing the large spending tx. These ""I don't like items X, Y, Z"" would not be processed by consensus, rather signal to Pi admins how to construct a replacement tx.

Pay volatility is a problem for me too. Put simply, not getting the money you billed for is a problem if you can't afford the gamble.

Reducing the delay between the end of the billing period (end of month) and the payment reduces the impact of volatility. But to really solve it there must be a mechanism to offer stable pay for desired part of the wage. If that is achieved, the delay can be longer.

This proposal acknowledges the current and future importance of VSPs, and the risk of VSPs hosted in colocation facilities being coerced to drain the Treasury. There is another risk - they can be coerced to reveal stakeholder information (IP addresses, email addresses, support comms, voting addresses).

Even without pressing VSPs, the fact that many voting addresses are reused helps blockchain analysis to connect the dots. It can be used to identify stakeholders, who can be coerced to vote certain way not only on treasury spend but on blocks, consensus changes and proposals. Or just give away their funds. More stakeholder and voter privacy makes higher security of the network.

With this design VSPs will play even bigger role than today and be more wanted targets. Despite being critical part of infrastructure VSP software has serious privacy flaws and doesn't even receive regular code updates (multiple open issues and pull requests are idle for months).

I think it is important to pump VSP privacy before this treasury spend system comes into effect, specifically:

1. [eliminate VSP address reuse](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/311) and associated clustering of voter funds which degrades their privacy
2. [make email address optional](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/274) and recommend to create new accounts
3. do best effort to [eliminate accounts](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/100) alltogether

As I have pointed out prior, we are going to start with training wheels. Only allowing one transaction per month at this time. We may consider this in the future.

> How big can the spend tx be - how many payments can be done at once?

Current months treasury accumulation + 50%.

Hundreds.

> How will stakeholders' vote transactions look like?

This is indeed not very obvious from the text. What will happen is that we will add a permanent agenda that takes the vote identifier as the parameter and it'll then record the vote bits as any other agenda. We plan to let the user trust the Pi key and always vote per settings. This is to alleviate user interaction. 

> Can the VSP vote alert tools be extended to also watch block votes and consensus rule change votes?

That is part of the plan. We need those anyway so this is a nice excuse to get it all in.

> Why VSPs are needed to vote for the tx? Can't stakeholders just throw their votes into mempool and have them mined?

That would be great but that is not how it works. Voting requires signatures so something needs to be online to sign hence VSPs exist.

> Do (1) and (2) refer to exactly the same thing? Does ""off-chain"" simply mean it is not immediately published on the chain?

You have asked this before and the answer is not changing. Yes, they are the same, yes the transaction is published on Pi and not on the blockchain.

Does it mean two maturation periods or one?

Just one for the treasury transaction. The redeem transaction has normal blockchain rules. Only transactions that generate new coins are subject to maturation.

> Is ""this month"" it defined as a block interval (e.g. 8064 blocks) or a calendar month?

The plan is to use 8064 blocks.

> Do OP_TSPEND transactions have min and max block height (expiry)? How long can broadcasting of this tx be delayed? Can it slip into next month?

Ideally, it should be voted on before the next month. But I don't see any issues with voting on last months transaction at this time. Reality will set me straight. We will have to add pretty extensive UT for these changes and this is one of the edge cases we are going to have to reason through.

> Is it correct that this design will increase the amount of client communication with VSPs, e.g. the need to login in their web UIs or use the API?

""Prevent spending more than this months treasury accrued value + 50%""

I think this is fine for a 60% approval threshold. However, I envision unique and one time expenses that could arise in the long term future that could find the above constraint limiting. For example, an acquisition/buy in of a side project or feature like a decentralized oracle infrastructure integrated with Decred, would be expensive. The Decred community may want to make large one time spends from the Decred Treasury in the future. My concern is that the above constraint would prevent these in the first instance, and require a change in the consensus rules first before going through with a large expense. And maybe this should be the case, since it's essentially requiring a pre-vote before the main vote of the large expense.

There's a couple other ways this could be expanded though.

Prevent spending more than this months treasury accrued value + 50% (requires 60% approval)

> Prior to the draft transaction being published on-chain, stakeholders will have the opportunity to inspect the proposed spending on the Pi platform and ensure it adheres to proposals already passed on Pi.

How does this look? Pi admins publish a detailed, line-item report as a proposal, and stakeholders can comment/vote on it?

> If the transaction is voted down it will need to be reviewed and potentially broken up to deal with contention

Is there a process for dealing with this? I don’t see it in the technical implementation. While in general this makes sense, one factor to consider is potential disruption for current contractors, the majority of which will have honest invoices. Contractors are already subject to a high volatility during their billing period (averaged USD/DCR price), and are then subject to any volatility between when they send their invoice and when it is approved and paid (which can sometimes take up to a month). In recent months, this resulted in a 50% pay cut for contractors that had to sell to USD to pay bills. If stakeholders veto a draft treasury spend, which starts some kind of dispute resolution process and requires another vote, that could cause further disruption in pay that many contractors cannot absorb, and the project may talent (which is expensive to replace). If this is only a mechanism for defense against attack, and the stakeholders have already had a chance to review invoices, this seems sensible. But this review step has not been defined yet (see above). 

> Follow-up votes will determine the fate of individual costs.

Basically have the same question as above. Is there an imagined process for this?

> Originally, we were keen to have draft Treasury spends be assembled off-chain via Politeia, where stakeholders would approve the draw by voting on the draft transaction. 

I think I’m confused around the distinction between on-chain and off-chain here. Aren’t stakeholders voting on politeia proposals (such as this one) on-chain? how is this different?

> If the treasury transaction is approved it will be published on-chain and the contractors will be able to redeem their individual payouts.

So funds are not just sent to the contractor’s wallet address (the process now)? What is the redeem process?


In general, I think this is a step in the right direction. The basic infrastructure being proposed here will needed anyway for many things. My concern is that, by punting on some larger issues (such as how contentious items in the budget are resolved (either at the front end, or after a veto of the draft by stakeholders)), we miss opportunities to make this infrastructure more future-proof. My ability to judge the technical infrastructure is limited somewhat, however, by my ability to wrap my head around some of the technical details. I’ve got a decent grasp on how blockchain transactions work generally, but am having some confusion around some of the basic logic here. 
For instance, off-chain transactions are mentioned. But are not all transactions by definition on-chain?

> How does this look? Pi admins publish a detailed, line-item report as a proposal, and stakeholders can comment/vote on it?

That's right. The Pi administrators will publish the transaction that contains the entire treasury spend. People can look at it on the Pi website and comment before it is published for an on-chain vote. The idea is to make a human readable version of this for stakeholder evaluation.

> Is there a process for dealing with this? I don’t see it in the technical implementation. While in general this makes sense, one factor to consider is potential disruption for current contractors, the majority of which will have honest invoices. Contractors are already subject to a high volatility during their billing period (averaged USD/DCR price), and are then subject to any volatility between when they send their invoice and when it is approved and paid (which can sometimes take up to a month). In recent months, this resulted in a 50% pay cut for contractors that had to sell to USD to pay bills. If stakeholders veto a draft treasury spend, which starts some kind of dispute resolution process and requires another vote, that could cause further disruption in pay that many contractors cannot absorb, and the project may talent (which is expensive to replace). If this is only a mechanism for defense against attack, and the stakeholders have already had a chance to review invoices, this seems sensible. But this review step has not been defined yet (see above).

This is an accurate statement. The process has not been formalized yet. The reason is that in the many years of software development we have learned to only plan two steps ahead and evaluate where we stand after achieving set goals. Planning too far ahead pretty much always ends with reality colliding with the plan. So, yes it is hand-wavy but by design. Once the technical realities become apparent we can let them dictate the process.

> Basically have the same question as above. Is there an imagined process for this?

See prior comment.

> I think I’m confused around the distinction between on-chain and off-chain here. Aren’t stakeholders voting on politeia proposals (such as this one) on-chain? how is this different?

Politeia votes are decidedly off-chain. One of the biggest hurdles that will be overcome in this proposal is that we finally marry the two. Only consensus and protocol changes are voted on-chain. The treasury spends will be added to that list with this proposal.

> So funds are not just sent to the contractor’s wallet address (the process now)? What is the redeem process?

This is a technical reality. Blockchain can't magically send funds. The process that we will use mirrors the stake reward system. In the end, this should have minor to no impact on UX.

> In general, I think this is a step in the right direction. The basic infrastructure being proposed here will needed anyway for many things. My concern is that, by punting on some larger issues (such as how contentious items in the budget are resolved (either at the front end, or after a veto of the draft by stakeholders)), we miss opportunities to make this infrastructure more future-proof. My ability to judge the technical infrastructure is limited somewhat, however, by my ability to wrap my head around some of the technical details. I’ve got a decent grasp on how blockchain transactions work generally, but am having some confusion around some of the basic logic here. For instance, off-chain transactions are mentioned. But are not all transactions by definition on-chain?

This is a valid concern but this is where I point out that technical people think the other way around :-)

What this proposal does is add the basic building blocks we need in order to implement your big vision concerns. Again, the reason why some of those remain undefined is to let reality guide them vs promising something and then not being able to deliver it. Getting this stuff to work is hard enough as it is and then changing a promise during development (which invariably happens) is counterproductive.

And no, transactions are not always by definition on-chain. You can construct one and share that with people before pushing it to the mempool for inclusion on the blockchain.

The precautions of Pi draft key, constraints on the new OP codes, and staged migration of funds from the old wallet/system to the new, all seem prudent to me. I also appreciate that possible misbehavior of the Pi operators has been included in the threat model (voting on-chain so that Pi admins cannot censor votes). This rationale and motivation is familiar from Politeia itself, where the transparent censorship features have been designed by the same set of people who would have otherwise had power to abuse the system. I take this as further evidence that Company 0 is committed to moving towards a decentralized system that has no special role or privilege for themselves.

Some more specific questions/comments:

1. ""If the transaction is voted down it will need to be reviewed and potentially broken up to deal with contention. Follow-up votes will determine the fate of individual costs."" s_ben has [mentioned](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f/comments/4) this already, it also stands out to me as a potentially messy and difficult process, should it ever occur. It would be good to have a more detailed walkthrough of what would happen in this scenario, with a prospective timeline. I don't think this is needed yet, it could be done at some point while this system is being engineered. Alternatively, it may be worth breaking the spending down into 2 or 3 payments/domains to start with, in which case the monthly ticket votes would provide a more nuanced signal of how stakeholders perceive the value the Treasury is getting per domain. From a contractor perspective, if the approval rating for these big transactions was trending down month by month, it would be sub-optimal to not have a sense of where the perceived problems lie (e.g. is it on the dev or marketing side?). 
2. The audit tools sound great, I guess they can be applied to all VSP voting?

I'm going to have to meditate a bit on this, but for the moment  few questions regarding the technical side of things:

1. Given that the pi draft key will need to be part of consensus, what would be the point of a wallet ""distrusting"" the draft key (technical point 6)? It seems to me that once the consensus vote for introducing OP_TGEN/OP_TSPEND is approved, the only action available for a wallet is to vote yes/no/abstain on the spend transaction.

2. Clarifications for:

> Don't allow more than one approved OP_TSPEND per 28 days (8064 blocks)

So this will also block having two OP_TSPENDs being voted at the same time, right? Obviously I assume the pi operators won't honestly broadcast a new OP_TSPEND before the last one is either decisively voted approved/disapproved, I'm just trying to wrap my head around the consensus semantics for this tx type.

Also, will this be considered a stake transaction or a regular transaction (and therefore subject to block approval)? I'm assuming onchain voting on approval of TSPEND tx will only start after it's sufficiently confirmed.

3. On the example for the spend transaction, shouldn't inputs be:

```
in[0] =  <Pi draft key sig> TSPEND
```

that is, the sigscript is carrying a signature made by the pi draft key vs the key itself. Also, wouldn't it be better for the pi draft key actually be a multisig script or even a schnorr multisig key (with the corresponding p2sh being the consensus-enforced receiver of TGEN txs)? I'm just considering that, in case of a compromised (single) key, all payments would necessarily stop until a consensus change vote to replace the key is carried, which is less critical if it's only a single compromised key from a multisig set.

4. It would be helpful to see an example of a coinbase tx with OP_TGEN (similar to how it was done for OP_TSPEND).

5. Random thought: how about using the extended vote bits to signal approval/disapproval of individual outputs of the TSPEND tx? It would make tallying the votes slightly trickier, but alleviate some concerns about the on-chain voting blocking payment to all contractors due to a single ""undesired"" output (from the pov of voters).",6d50ee18c4072851056a0eeed6efa70cc1c12f851925190ff6d4caeb6d78e51037b139c6250330167612ba1ae12a0b605298a5bb7de359d5445456f67151da03,6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686,9,b6e07ed3b7fb6f0d4f00a56be41db12cf1259773be86e3a1f37bbad252a9e8748ac11f846efbe4ddc8e188cb36bccccdb5070401c4f98e0dba57b58524c8180e,1554292915,4,4.0,False,a287e4dc-9ba1-4eee-ab1f-9dcbf90c2f82,matheusd,

            Therefore seeing smartcash does not make us scammers please i know what croyptocurrency does and it means a lot to me working for any cryptocurrency project. Smartcash t-shirt on the google sheet was simply an  oversight. The proposal which i typed showed **decred t-shirt** but the google sheet which was prepared by another team memeber who has worked for smartcash, does not make us scammers please. The decred Ghana team is a group of experienced blockchain and cryptocurrency activists. We in the light of this plead your indulgence, for such an oversight which we agree and are sorry for, may be common among a team like ours. 
       We plead to the decred community that we are not scammers and dont have the intention to become cryptosscammers.

With our experience, we believe that cryptocurrency is the way, there are a lot of other things we plan to do which was not captured in the proposal. We are ready to travel the length and breadth of Ghana and the whole of Africa to preach decred.

       @degeri thanks for showing concern in this proposal. First contributor I contacted since I started this activity for decred, I appreciate your support and the guidance you have given me up to this level. Yes, I can confidently say that I have worked with Dash as an ambassador before. That made me had a lot of experience when it comes to cryptocurrency ecosystem in Africa and Ghana to be precise. I have attended several conferences, radio talk show, cryptocurrency seminars, meetups and had also organized some myself. Conflict of interest? I will say no, it started like this. It is in early 2017 that I started getting involve in cryptocurrency then I realized I really enjoyed using btc as compared to normal currency (great advantage over fiat). My father who was in Turkey was sending me remittances to my phone through btc which was easier, cheap and simpler as compared to western union. I started talking to people about btc and decided to research more into it because I realize am lonely in this field and it can also arguably change the financial system in Ghana if much attention is pay to it. Is through my research that I found Dash. Because i have learned a lot about cryptocurrency I was selected by a Nigerian Dash ambassador who submitted a proposal building a DASHYAfrica to work as an ambassador of Dash for Ghana. Through one blockchain conference somebody mentioned decred claiming he doesn't know the different between the two, before then I have never heard of decred. I research into the project then I realized this is where I belonged. Since then I started preaching about decred. 
    Secondly the research was than this way. we visited all exchanges both physical and online we realized none of them, has decred been listed. In Ghana telegram and whatsapp is also used as p2p platform, of all the p2p platform we are in nobody has mentioned of selling decred before it is always btc, Dash and ethereum. We also got to know that to 10 Ghanaians gathered 3 of them know about bitcoin and the remaining 7 have zero knowledge about btc we therefore concluded that 70% of Ghanaians don't know about btc since to every 10 people is almost certain that only 3 know about btc. This research was done through observing, asking questions and also after attending and organizing crypto and non-crypto events, this in fact is very true since we have some shops that accept btc as medium of exchange. Concerning why we included merchants we realized that one problem that could hinder businesses from accepting decred is lack of merchant that will directly buy the dcr and changed to fiat for them without first converting to btc to avoid fees charged by exchanges like changelly and shapeshift since if that happen it could affect their initial capital due to high fees charged in converting dcr to btc. Merchants are included so that we can build a complete ecosystem in Ghana where everybody benefits. The other three core members with their social media accounts are provided below:

Hi George,

First of all, thanks for finally putting up the proposal. At a quick glance, these are my observation, starting from the good point:

1. Motivation and its potential to decred ecosystem is sound.
2. Some of the plans stated (especially those regarding the improvement of usability of decred as a currency) is good.

Unfortunately however, the good stuff ends here, and the rest are my concern regarding this proposal, mostly regarding the execution part of the said plans. (also forgive me for being blunt)

1. The pre-amble looks lazily copy and pasted and to me, it looks like very little effort(if any) is put into researching those numbers. Merely quoting a single source no matter how reputable the source is, is just not convincing enough. The blurry image attached also seems to be hastily downloaded from somewhere.(with no credit given to its source)
2. The job scope seems a little overly ambitious for the time frame given. Given your past contributions which i've seen in slack (and I thank you for that), i also think that the budget asked is a little bit on the high side especially for a developing country which still has a relatively low cost of living. 16k for each region for each month will work out to 160k for 10 regions (if the final target is as you described) is a lot to ask for. The only concrete evidence that I observed so far were some very amateurishly put together casual meeting photos WITHOUT any video content at all. This has been asked many times because the most important is the actual content of delivery, but it seems like everytime this was brought up by the community members, you avoided the subject.
3. The plans are not detailed enough, with some random target numbers being seemingly thrown around. (i.e: 10 universities, 10 regions, 10000 target audiences??). Mind to elaborate each of this region along with its universities in question? Otherwise, this only greatly reduces the credibility of your proposal.
4. ""Constant social media marketing"": Do you have any existing proof of work being uploaded to any of the said social media? Any youtube videos? Given the extensive coverage already done by existing contributors (Ditto, Denni's tutorial video, decred digest, decred community website, official twitter/facebook, etc), how do you plan on further expanding this by creating an African specific channel? If am not wrong, English is still one of the main language being used in  Africa so the audience will have no problem looking for information in the already established sources. Creating your own social media channels seems redundant in this case.
5. Above all, have you researched the hurdle that you have to go through by asking merchants to adopt decred as a cryptocurrency payment method? Is there any known (or potential future) cryptocurrency laws in Africa that might prevent this from being implemented smoothly? How confident are you in convincing them to 'embrace' decred?
6. Referral system: You did not mention where do these referral rewards and 'winning prizes' comes from. Are they part of the budget?

These are my immediate concerns so far, i will add-on as and when i can think of a new ones. Thank you for your time to read and i hope that you will not take this the wrong way.",95b08b9ad1697c4b9bcd70c8323b952e93c61778d414af83cfbe949b60654c04e13acb9aafc68592bcd3646fba154286341a000b3ab9466b36f336bbe6d43f07,88274f3fb81b459ac4db997ce32c1ee79ed77c62ed29b5dbd4b7ef4cfad6eaf1,2,2fd827c4159bc9be40c45414ffe74c7997522d829041665618fbc1599499eeaa1f1e58e33601f48cb0379fc5cafcfb830a5845d2f48a0cea0dde480e6bcb0809,1553100348,6,6.0,False,9af99901-60ab-4bff-8080-6eb44f5692e1,gravityz3r0,

   Thanks for showing concern in this proposal @gravity. I will love to answer your question base on how it is numbered and structured. Is unfortunate the detailed budget we included in the proposal was private. We are sorry for the inconvenience we have cause to you and the whole community, this is the link to the detailed budget  which is not private;  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10DK84SJcsxY6XgiJh3XMabhCjDv5dvEmhGEtOVSQDc8.              
  1. Concerning preamble, it is not something we were hiding we even mentioned paxful CEO and also the website to clearly show that we copied. However some items in it clearly  show that we did not lazily copy as you are saying. For example we included #endbankingfraud in the preamble,  is through our research that we found out that through twitter a bunch of Africans are showing their dislike for the current banking system due to gross and minor fraud they are encountering individually. So to say it was lazily copied is something that baffled me. We did a lot of research moving from website to website then we came about that information about Africa. We wanted the community to have an overview on how Africa is and the current state of the continent. We copied but to say we lazily copied is somehow too strong to me. The image is quite clear over here it shocks us that it is a bit blurry after uploading. May be the quality was reduced after uploading it. All links concerning wherever we took some vital information from will be added to the proposal soon. We thought the community don't need them so we excluded most of them. 
   2. concerning time frame, it is properly proportional to the work and the ambitions we want to achieved we shall add time-line and milestone to the proposal and all that ambiguity will be solved. Thanks for recognizing our work but if you say amateurish work, I agree with you some of the events we organized pictures was taken by our phone which make the work somehow look amateur but a lot went into it during and after the organization. 1. getting proper venue 2. collaboration with other events organizers, in some situation we have to pay money before we are allowed to speak 3. there are some situations that we spoke under certain events that we did not post on any community platform at all because we realized the community will say we are doing amateur work, there are situations enquiry desk was set at events for participant to ask question concerning decred but we never share on slack the pictures look amateur after the events. Pictures of such events will be post soon. Concerning budget sorry for the privacy of the sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10DK84SJcsxY6XgiJh3XMabhCjDv5dvEmhGEtOVSQDc8 check it. It will convinced you that the budget is not high and that it follows the plans and the things we budgeted for.
    3. In case of social media we are still working on dropping videos specifically for the African market. for instance, how Africans see cryptocurrency is a bit different from how the Western world see it. In Africa we preach about being your own bank, ability to spend the credits everywhere, the fight is still between fiat and cryptocurrency, full of peer to peer, using it to received remittances sometimes for export and import transactions, therefore the marketing message we put across should be different even though the basics must be the same we shall therefore use existing marketing materials and also add new ones that are tailored for the African market.
   5. concerning hurdles to be accepted as medium of exchange I cannot say all barriers are removed in Ghana but it’s in the process let me drop some news links that justify that Ghana is one of the countries in Africa that is ready to make laws for cryptocurrency regulations https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/business/Cryptocurrency-Advocates-push-for-swift-laws-by-BoG-686117#
https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/business/BoG-assures-provision-of-regulations-to-support-blockchain-innovations-706509 https://bitcoinafrica.io/2019/02/06/ghana-cryptocurrency-regulation-sec/ https://www.africa.com/cryptocurrency-regulation-africa-slowly-picking-up-the-pace/ Even though there are no laws regulating it there are also no laws prohibiting it. Even though it will be difficult convincing a number of businesses to accept it as medium of exchange our main target is to provide them with the necessary information and education so that when crypto is regularize, they have no option that to choose decred. Even before then, companies, grocery shops, malls among other businesses can choose to accept it as medium of exchange provided, they have correct information and education. We have few shops down here that accept bitcoin.

Why not change the message to suit the economy of the various continent to solve the problems each continent is facing. Maybe other continent need decred as store of Value which is the primary goal of decred, but maybe other continents also needs decred in another form that does not mean the people promoting it over there are ignoring the primary goal of decred but rather being creative and dynamic. Should we forget decred ability to be used to receive remittances? Should we forget decred ability as making peer to peer transactions easy? So you mean we shouldn’t talk about its ability to be a medium of exchange? What of the 70 percent underbanked and unbanked population in Africa? we shouldn’t tell them they can be their own bank through decred, what of those who have lost trust in the current financial system we shouldn’t tell them decred is offering them the best form of financial system you mean we should ignore all the above and primarily preach decred as store of value?

Here is the case we are lagging behind due to lack of enough education and outreach about decred.

We plead with the community to support this grassroot project improving technology is good but raising the standards of living in some countries through decred is an awesome and great activity for this great cryptocurrency project(decred). For decred being use as store of Value, it  can easily be achieved when other factors are rightly in place. It’s not that the decred Ghana team have no in depth knowledge about the project (I studied this project for 3 month before I started doing meetup and to attend events in the name of decred) but we believed for the credits to be used as **store of value** then we have to make sure  (decred) first have value in the Ghana economy and Africa at large. If they will use it as medium of exchange, if Merchants are ready to exchange dcr to fiat and fiat to dcr, if majority of exchanges in Africa list decred, when decred is integrated into various cryptocurrency and blockchain platform, when majority of the cryptocurrency community in Africa now use decred, when decred now have a lot of use cases in Africa. Using it as store of value will happen organically and automatically. Because decred will become a cryptocurrency with utility and real value.

First of all this is a very ambitious plan. People familiar with the project would agree this is not the usual way how decred approach things. 

Ditto is well established and well connected setup and yet their props took quite some effort to pass. 

IMO i would say 
- Start with the smaller and lower cost items. 
- Start with one/two event instead of packaging it to a 3 mths commitment. 
- Drop the airdrop/free $ idea. That is not the only way to fuel adoption in fact i think its inapproriate to fuel adoption with that. 
- I also think that smaller items costing less than couple hundred can slide under events / marketing budget which should be a better way to prove quality of your work. 

The fact is there are lots of scams around cryptospace, I dont know for sure if you are one of them but for sure decred is very cautious and serious about governing and protecting the funds. 

I will vote No to what i see at the moment but dont take that personally. Whatever happen to the proposal i hope you stay with the community and continue contributing and i wish you all the best with the props.

A possible solution is to have a special type of testnet DCR (tDCR) which you will be free to distribute which is fundamentally worthless now. These 'marked' tDCR could become redeemable for mainnet (real) DCR sometime in future (subject to vote).

In the meantime, the tDCR having no real value will allow you to demonstrate the technology and not be accused of being a scammer by the larger community. It will also lead to increased attacks on the testnet due to the lower hash rate protecting it which is great for the community as a whole as it will allow the testnet to be tested more thoroughly!

It will also provide many individuals in Africa with the tools to barter/trade safely which is the whole point of this exercise IMHO.

Finally, I'm sure many of us who have obelisks sitting as doorstops would be willing to donate hash power to helping secure the testnet if this crazy comment comes to fruition.",9318b1bc42b137c5d509f832b0cacb489b13e533086045c1c47684d638e05af3f5826e51051576438d448ede572d1e741b8d4989fb40e2c3527eecaa1a905a0b,5d5565d8b11a0357e19c021bcb67177e43c8eb655e4037bdfd8dc9489fc71c45,43,a5adef64f7ae486a774ef48895557764e620369d41abd69c7e6f33e8200359377af8cd704fe988206124ea5e05997778745d4fc3cc3fcc20b6f9cd8dece4c304,1554526820,0,,False,87a84587-902c-4535-96c7-c92784c7167e,lewildbeast,

Decred needs to evolve as follows:

1. Collectible
2. SoV

IMO, we are still in the collectible phase and focusing on payments and merchant adoption now is a waste of time for 2 reasons:

1) Decred is still too volatile to be a good medium of exchange
2) We haven't figured out scalability/payment infrastructure yet

 1. concerning preamble, it is not something we were hiding we even mentioned paxful CEO and also the website to clearly show that we copied but to say it was lazily copied is something that baffled me. we did a lot of research moving from website to website then we came about that information on Africa. We wanted the community to have an overview on how Africa is and the current state  of the continent. We copied but to say we lazily copied is somehow too strong to me. the image is quite clear over here it shocks us that  its a bit blurry after uploading. may be the quality was reduced after uploading it. All links concerning wherever we took some vital information from will be added to the proposal soon. we thought the community don't need them so we excluded most of them.
2. concerning time frame its properly proportional to the work and the ambitions we want to achieved we shall add time-line and milestone to the proposal and all that ambiguity will be solved. Thanks for recognizing our work but if you say amateurish work i agree with you some of the events we organized pictures was taken by our phone which make the work somehow look amateur but a lot went into it during and after the organization. 1. getting proper venue 2. collaboration with other events organizers in some situation we paid money before we are allow to speak 3. there are some situations that we spoke under certain events that we did not post on any community platform at all because we realized the community will say we are doing amateur work, there are situations enquiry desk was set at events for participant to ask question concerning deCRED but we never share on slack the pictures look amateur after the events. Pictures of such events will be post soon. concerning budget sorry for the privacy of the sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10DK84SJcsxY6XgiJh3XMabhCjDv5dvEmhGEtOVSQDc8 check it here it will convinced you that the budget is not high and that it follows the plans and the things we budgeted for. 
4. In case of social media we are still working on dropping videos specifically for the African market. for instance how Africans see cryptocurrency is a bit different from  how the western world see it.In Africa we preach about being your own bank, ability to spend the credits everywhere, the fight is still  between fiat and cryptocurrency, full of peer to peer, using it to received remittances sometimes for export and import transactions therefore the marketing message we put across should be different even though the basics must be the same we shall therefore used existing  marketing materials and also add new ones that are tailored for the African market.
5. concerning hurdles to be accepted as medium exchange i cannot say all barriers are removed in Ghana but its in the process let me drop some news links that justify that Ghana is one of the countries in Africa that is ready to make laws for cryptocurrency regulations https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/business/Cryptocurrency-Advocates-push-for-swift-laws-by-BoG-686117#

https://www.africa.com/cryptocurrency-regulation-africa-slowly-picking-up-the-pace/
even though there are no laws regulating it there are also no laws prohibiting it. even though it will be difficult convincing a number of them to accept it as medium exchange our main target its to provide them with the neccessary information and eduction so that when crypto is regularize they have no options that to choose deCRED. even then companies shops among others can choose to accept it as medium of exchange provided they have correct information and education. we have few shops down here that accept bitcoin. these are clarities i can make for now i will add more as time goes on.

First contributer i contacted since i started this activities for deCRED i appreciate your support and the guidance you have given me up to this level. Yes i can confidently say that i have worked with DASH as an ambassador before. That made me had a lot of experience when its comes to cryptocurrency ecosystem in Africa and Ghana to be precise. i have attend several conferences, radio talk show, events, meetups and had also organized some myself. Conflict of interest? i wiill say no, it started like, this is in early 2017 that i started doing cryptocurrency then i realized i really enjoyed using btc as compared to normal currency.(great advantage over fiat) because my father who was in Turkey was sending me remittances to my phone through btc which was easier, cheap and simpler as compared to western union. i started talking to people about btc and decided  to research more into it because i realize am lonely in this field and can also arguably changed the financial system in Ghana if much attention is pay to it. is through my research that i found DASH. Because i have learned a lot about cryptocurrency i was chosen by a Nigerian  DASH ambassador who submitted a proposal building a DASHYAfrica to work as an ambassador for Ghana.Through one blockchained conference somebody mentioned deCRED claiming he doesn't know the different between the two before then i have never head of deCRED. i research into the project then i realized this is where i belong since then i started preaching about deCRED.
Secondly the research was than this way. we visited all exchanges both physical and online  we realized none of them ,has deCRED been listed. In Ghana telegram and whatsapp is also used as p2p platform of all the p2p platform we are in nobody  has mentioned of  selling deCRED before its always btc Dash and ethereum. To ten people gathered in Ghana 7 of them knew about bitcoin the remaining 3 have zero knowledge about btc this reseaerch was done through observing and asking questions and also through crypto and non crypto events i have attended. we then concluded that 70% of Ghanaians know btc in fact this is true since there are shops that accept btc in Ghana.
concerning why we included merchants we realized that one problem that could hinder businesses from accepting deCRED is lack of merchant that will directly buy the dcr and changed to fiat for them  without first converting to btc to avoid fees charged by exchanges like changelly and shapeshift since if that happen it could affect their initial capital due to high fees charged in converting dcr to btc. Merchants are included so that we can  build a complete ecosystem in Ghana where everybody benefits.

Can you explain this line item on your budget, George? 

Smartcash T-Shirts 7 * 800 = $5600

Are you expecting us to pay $5600 for printing Smart Cash Tshirts? 

One plausible explanation for this is that your are such a dumb and lazy &*% $%#$%# that you pushed the same darn proposal to some other crypto and copy pasted it here. You  look like a scammer to me if this is true. 

Country specific teams can do a good job but handing over $40,000 to your kind of proposal owners will be a big shame.

Do remember very well when the exorbitant early sign-up fees were a big issue. Even though the rough consensus back in the day was not to pay for any (and this being a well principled decision as Pi wasn't released yet) worth to notice there was still a big and well reasoned push by various community members, traders, etc to even pay for example for Binance integration from their own pockets. Reason being as that would have likely meant a significant liquidity boost for the project at the time. Now the cost here isn’t a fee for sign-up but for funding for the development man hours. To me this seems reasonable and something exactly the dev treasury should be used for.

I rate proposals as this by whether it adds any value to the Decred ecosystem. Getting implemented into a number of different wallets (which are of decent quality) is by all means a good thing and grows decentralization. It’s also one of those small steps that adds up towards maturing the project in a longer run, which is needed before wider adoption.",500dfaba073feb62ca3b048b55fd0a1ff38819e042fa3b2d54957d1b0ec95457e0d38c5f3c673d087034673bcd41c1ee8356380ac7d3acdc7b092aeae7c7a30f,1602347ec404e3209b65b29240e9146eba135a99ce3d5f73f8ee5a9115bc534a,11,7e33d778cba021316de1d21ac27cc17cd8a227920dd7b86bd1453072c1a8913bc6c33c5d75788ca8e2c542b8b7bb4bde2f2b3c9fe2d9781961f9e948cdaabd03,1552615766,6,6.0,False,ba96e181-abff-4c1a-b2be-9bb916ea4083,linnutee,

Did [all other coins](https://github.com/TrustWallet/wallet-core) pay for integration and hosting their Blockbook instances?

Why didn't Trust Wallet team submit a proposal themselves?

> To facilitate balance lookup, searches, and other functionality without relying on a 3rd party server, Trust Wallet utilizes Blockbook, the back-end service for Trezor wallet.

This reads like to be autonomous, one needs to run the Decred full node _and_ Blockbook indexer, which is similar to self-hosting Decred full node and dcrdata today.

> The Blockbook development required for Trust Wallet will also allow for additional integrations with existing Trezor technology 

What kind of ""additional integrations"" this makes possible? This is strategic question - what Decred gains from Blockbook integration if Trust Wallet turns out unpopular?

How does current Trezor integration work if Blockbook still doesn't support Decred?

Blockbook is Trezor's ""territory"" so to speak, isn't it their job to code it?

> 2. Add backend/node support for Decred to Blockbook following the Blockbook contribution guide (to be completed and hosted by the Decred Project team).

I assume this means that Decred support is integrated into main/upstream Blockbook, not someone's fork.

Why does Decred need to host an indexer for wallet users? This is replacing one 3rd party watching users' requests (e.g. Trust Wallet team or whoever runs ""default"" Blockbook servers) with another (Decred team). This doesn't fundamentally improve the privacy of Trust Wallet DCR users, unless they host Blockbook server themselves. If the majority of users are expected to not run their Blockbooks and rely on 3rd party middleman server, this is an investment into another Electrum-like infrastructure that Decred used to avoid and went straight to SPV ""done right"". _(please correct if my reasoning is wrong)_

If Trust Wallet implemented Decred's SPV protocol it would look much better to me.

There is no integration payment.  These are hard costs for development and hosting fees.

I don't know if all other coins have paid, the one project I was able to talk to in detail about the process did and also paid their own developers for the work that was required.

2. Why didn't Trust Wallet team submit a proposal themselves?

They aren't receiving the funding, there is no ""fee"", part of it is going to an independent developer in their community and part to a developer in our community(to be determined).

3. All the Blockbook questions:

I can't really address the ""what if"" questions easily or the ""what will"" questions.  Many other projects have worked to integrate into Blockbook, here is the list:
[Blockbook list of coins/ports](https://github.com/trezor/blockbook/blob/master/docs/ports.md)

The Trust Wallet team has already started their work in good faith and is a very popular project.  At worst if they are not popular this integration brings us a step closer to native wallet integration with Trezor.

4. If Trust Wallet implemented Decred's SPV protocol it would look much better to me.

We can't expect other projects to change how they do things to support our project, maybe if we were a top 5 project, but I think we need to be pragmatic about cooperation/integration if we want to be successful. Also although I don't believe enough testing/verification has been done all the wallet makers I have spoken too are unwilling to risk performance issues supporting project specific SPV/node implementations.

5. In case the Ongoing development requires more than 50 USD a month else the wallet is unusable for Decred, who will pay for that? If Blockbook devs decide to do a huge refactoring of the codebase, who will pay for updating and testing Decred part?

We would need to have another proposal if that were to occur to request funding beyond what is scoped in the proposal, or perhaps we will make inroads with Blockbook development through this cooperation (they have a fantastic team/product) who would be helpful in that event.

This seems a good integration for the blockbook part as it allows easier integration into future trezor products. 

Although i am not sure about the trustwallet part of integration. Concerns being

- Its a ETH and dapps focused product, now acquired by Binance, not sure what kind of influence ETH devs/team and Binance have on the listing on wallet and exchange.

- As with every integration, what are delisting rules?

- Does support for so many coins/chains leads to bloated code and thus bugs? Can we have some kind of code audit report for security?

- Is wallet app going to be integrated with Binance exchange in some way? If yes this will be good for binance traders but will open up new attack vector imo.

I think the cost of integration and work required seems reasonable. Is the $50/month hosting cost is for one instance of Blockbook? Should we not have multiple geographically distributed instances to ensure smooth availability.

Having experienced first hand the quality of work that the Decred team (and community) oversees, I have no doubt that this has potentially to become a widely used exchanged.

In summary, I would be in favor, but it will somewhat depend on the following:



1. **The Benefits to Decred**
In many ways, I feel an exchanged such as this would be a much needed ""Gift"" to the community, whilst the bill will be picked up by existing Decred stake-holders, as well as the time & effort put in by the Core team. As a result, I think it would be good to understand a more comprehensive value proposition that this may hold for Decred itself?  I agree that the marketing side of things would be a great start, especially if this becomes a popular exchange, but would be keen to understand potential other benefits to Decred as a project, and as a community.


2. **Confidence in obtaining credible and capable contractors**
How confident are you that there are available contractors that will be able to do this work, within budget, whilst adhering to the high quality that the Decred community is used to?


3. **Projected Cost**
The projected cost of this project currently specifies quite a wide range. What would the difference be (from a delivery, quality, features, and time-line perspective) between the lower end and the upper end?

> Any protections against fast bots like per-account rate limiting?

I had mentioned in my blog post on the topic, which I will link to in an update to the proposal, that very simple rules could be created to rate-limit trades, e.g. UTXOs used for orders must have not moved for N hours or more to be considered valid.  This would greatly limit the rate at which orders can be placed by fast bots and mitigate the vast majority of known ""dark"" trading patterns.  

> Any plans to actively engage other chains to integrate?

This process has already begun in our [atomicswap repo on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/), where other projects have added support for doing atomic swaps on their corresponding chains.

> Any plans for protocols that don't leave a trace of swap on the chains?

The first step is always making it work.  Once it is working, obfuscating the swaps on the corresponding chains can happen.  IIRC, there was discussion about using some homomorphic encryption tricks to do just this on BCT.

> Does the TLS mention mean the system involves Certificate Authorities?

I believe the CA system is less than worthless - it is incredibly harmful to communications security.  We use TLS with dcrd, dcrwallet and dcrctl with self-signed certificates for exactly this reason.  The whole CA system exists so that web users can try to avoid knowing anything about security via a list of approved CAs bundled with each browser.",24f50064b87bab373f7fdcf1f0b66bcd40e14672b261b8a9dce01e367453389691b88dfd3238da6d9c2c2bc2d7b58aa35b60ae167d9313e30ffb39f93626cc0a,e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360,12,ac53cf31fa15553cb9ee3022dabd3ec506956d3b1fc5b94c283a8b9420277766638e0388252a3a03915640f5d7b0d6402c2a989615b868a5333159330c463803,1549472468,6,6.0,False,fe62dd6a-2cc6-4d41-abd0-522528d33ae7,jy-p,

First, I consider ryanzim to provide generally good constructive criticism, which I will address below.  Second, ryanzim is a developer for the Exodus wallet, which, as far as I am aware, collects fees on exchanges performed in their wallet and is their project's primary source of income.  This presents, IMO, a pretty clear conflict-of-interest regarding the view he has shared on the proposal.

I agree that the upper end cost cited for the work is high at USD 1M, and it was not intended to indicate that would be _likely_ cost of the work, merely that we should not entertain proposals to build it for any amount greater than that.

Regarding the relevance of the proposal, I would argue that it is very much relevant to Decred.  Several notable DCR holders have brought up that they consider our lack of liquidity to be a problem that needs fixing.  The conventional solution to this problem is to pay a market maker (""MM"") to make your project's market on one or more exchanges, and this typically costs USD 30K / mo or more and gives the MM an enormous amount of control over the market price of your asset.  One of the reasons that MMs cost so much is that they are typically experienced proprietary traders who have to deal with the risks and stresses of a wide variety of bots being run against them.  If the MM gets cleaned out by someone else's bots, they have no reason to continue making the market and will quit.  If we build a system that uses pseudorandom order matching, this substantially reduces the threat of being gamed by others' bots, which lowers the risks and stresses associated with being a MM.  Lowering the barriers to being a MM will lead to a deeper order book and help decentralize our liquidity, versus paying one or a few MMs to perform this task for us.

Comparing a custodial ""instant"" exchange to a DEX that uses atomic swaps is comparing apples and oranges.  ChangeNOW is certainly an interesting service, but it is permissioned - per their FAQ ""ChangeNOW’s AML/KYC procedure is supported by an automated risk prevention system. If a transaction is marked suspicious by this system, the exchange is put on hold and the customer in question is then asked to confirm their identity.""  Note that instant exchanges do nothing to solve the problem of order book depth that we have, which creates slippage for people entering and exiting DCR positions.

I am disappointed to see you characterize this proposal as VC-like.  If we take a moment to look at the big picture with cryptocurrencies, it goes something like this:

* The irresponsible behavior of banks cued SN to create/release Bitcoin, which decentralized value storage and transmission via gamification of the timestamping process.
* The central planning committee of Bitcoin Core / Blockstream cued me to work with tacotime and _ingsoc to create and release Decred, which decentralized sovereignty via gamification of the decision-making process.

My motivation to create Decred was based on experiencing the bullshit of Bitcoin's central planning committee firsthand, and I had the luxury of tacotime having proposed a system that could address precisely this problem concurrent with my experiences.  After 3 years of building out Decred, it has become clear to me that a major hurdle for the project is that of market liquidity.  This proposal is a reflection of my seeing this centralization and gatekeeping of liquidity as being the next major problem for a cryptocurrency-based ecosystem to resolve, i.e.

* The centralization of liquidity within the CC ecosystem cued me to propose decentralized exchange via ""ungamification"" of the trading process.",4fd94edecbf973ea3f2779d8d770075894c8c18b88bc6fbb73c0a5db3d33f65fdecfbca0a7595afc39dae47bad6026c46c57ab5eaedbe36699b5867bed15c405,e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360,15,fdea538af785ae79c8afd33ed0d957013e892d8d1d9c0eae782267e474546aaf34c02a8acf3dee9f0d79a8af718ccfc6fce809be095959a43dd475848d28620e,1549477522,6,7.0,False,fe62dd6a-2cc6-4d41-abd0-522528d33ae7,jy-p,1.0

The DEX landscape is indeed crowded.  I am of the view that most of these projects have the wrong incentive structure, i.e. collecting fees on trades, which is a pretty fundamental difference between what is being proposed here and what already exists.  When you're collecting fees on trades, you're incentivized to generate volume, not order book depth, which is what I believe we all really want.

Your issues with lot sizes are valid, but the reality of working with on-chain transactions as the basis for unfalsifiable orders acts as a strong constraint on what we can do.  The partial fill problem is tricky.  I would expect there to be several lot sizes being traded concurrently in a healthy DEX-based market, which would mean there would be several pairs traded, each at a pair of chosen lot sizes.  In more detail, we could have DCR/BTC markets that have (DCR 10, BTC 0.01), (DCR 1, BTC 0.001), and (DCR 0.1, BTC 0.0001) lot sizes, where episodic arbitrage occurs between them.

I am aware of the potential conflict-of-interest here. Personally, I have serious reservations about the architecture of the exchange itself (fee structure, etc.), but I have refrained from discussing them here since there is almost no way I can discuss them without potential conflict-of-interest. Instead, I have solely focused on the issue of whether the Decred treasury should pay for the DEX, since I feel there is less potential for conflict-of-interest there.

Also, for the record, all my opinions here are my own personal opinions, not those of my employer, and I am receiving no compensation for expressing my opinions here. Hopefully that goes without saying, but I thought I'd make it explicitly clear.

Understood, thanks for clarifying. Regardless, I believe my point still stands that this is a significant outlay of funds, and needs careful consideration.

Regarding your two paragraphs about liquidity/MMs/instant exchanges:

It seems I somewhat misunderstood your main intention behind the exchange; I was arguing under the assumption that by ""increasing accessibility"", you meant ""making it easier for new people (either noobs to crypto, or people already in crypto, but new to DCR) to buy their first DCR"". Reading your reply here, it seems I've misunderstood.

If I'm understanding you correctly, your primary motivation for building the exchange is:

1. There isn't enough Decred liquidity
1. You don't want to pay a MM to increase liquidity
1. Instead, you want to build a DEX that will want to make people be MMs for DCR without direct pay

1.  ChangeNOW does nothing to solve your primary gripe with the current situation: liquidity

> I am disappointed to see you characterize this proposal as VC-like

VC-like probably isn't the right term to use. I don't mean that your exchange proposal is some ridiculous get-rich-quick scheme; I don't mean that the proposal fundamentally misunderstands what crypto is all about, like too many VC firms do; etc.

Let me try to clarify my position on what I feel should and should not receive treasury funding. Examples are probably best to illustrate my point.

Things the treasury is for funding:

- Maintaining Decred software
- Building a mobile wallet for Decred
- Building Politeia
- Building a DAE to manage the treasury funds
- Building libraries to make it easier for other products to implement Decred
- Funding marketing for Decred

Things the treasury could possibly fund (debatable):

- Integration into an existing ATM network
- Integration fees for a hardware wallet

Things out of scope for treasury funding (in my OP, I incorrectly used the term VC-like to refer to these kinds of things):

- Building an all-new hardware wallet
- Building a new crypto ATM machine that supports Decred
- Building an exchange (centralized or decentralized)

In short, this exchange may or may not become popular. If it becomes popular, it may or may not help Decred liquidity (i.e. maybe it'll just be the most popular way to exchange BTC/LTC). We have no way of knowing for sure.

I fail to see how building a better exchange is any more deserving of funding from the treasury, than building a better hardware wallet or ATM machine. Does the world need better hardware wallets, ATM machines, or exchanges? Maybe, maybe not; but I don't believe the treasury needs to fund any of these projects.",af38dc951b3e0c187d4086b2e2cce91a48465cd6fd4871d31bc5bd182cf5092590c6524fa5872c8dd2a87d0737e717c61baaa350831498c1371954956d6d5904,1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106,18,9238d82c525e918921fec0752d0b33707e77e630d20c79c2de5aed2682cf76698d39874fee69a6a5d5849a97d589242dae925168cbbed6ac8f24c4fdf501c905,1549481752,2,3.0,False,8b7137f1-bb9e-46a3-bb20-f9750863aeec,ryanzim,1.0

It would be inappropriate to spend this amount of treasury funds on a low project priority DEX.  What if the price of Decred continues to drop?  Despite what some people believe, the treasury will run dry someday.  The amount of Decred being proposed for the dex will fund a decade or more of critical development needs years from now.

In my opinion the actual resources expended will be closer to the upper limit of the cost and time estimates.  I’m basing this on the historical performance of milestone forecasting on this project.

At this time I would vote no on a 100% DCR funded dex.  I would be open to partnering with other projects on this effort or deferring the effort to a later date when the project market cap has improved.

My view on the dex is based on how I perceive its value to Decred.

As discussed on Slack, I think there are a lot of good ideas in the implementation details and a lot of the issues raised are well founded and researched. My objection is on a few fronts simultaneously, although none of them relate to the technical implementation details - not because I don't have reservations, but because the other objections supersede them anyway. So, in no particular order:

1. There is little guarantee that the exchange will gain traction and aid Decred in any meaningful way.  
   1. Numerous similar projects with great teams have tried and failed to gain liquidity (even centralised exchanges with large budgets).  
   2. I'm unsure if a DEX is what the vast majority of people that will bring liquidity want; most people I know, whilst they grumble at KYC, are quite happy with Binance, Kraken, Bitstamp, etc.  
   3. It is possible that even if the DEX attracted liquidity for some crosses (such as ETH/BTC, or BCH/BTC), it still might not attract liquidity for DCR.
2. This would benefit all cryptocurrencies listed on the DEX so the cost to develop should be split, not fully funded by Decred.
3. One of the justifications for this proposal is that it will increase liquidity, but as objection #1 states it's quite a risky bet. There is a much more measurable method to increase liquidity (and thus indirectly increase market cap): designated market making (DMM) (https://sci-hub.tw/10.1017/S0022109000004166). Of course I am biased, but I don't agree with the objections given to using a DMM (and the empirical evidence backs me up):
> The conventional solution to this problem is to pay a market maker (""MM"") to make your project's market on one or more exchanges, and this typically costs USD 30K / mo or more and gives the MM an enormous amount of control over the market price of your asset.  

$30,000 seems a lot at first, but when you realise that empirically DMM's add 5+% to your market cap, that means it'd be worth about $7m to Decred as a whole and ~$12.5k/month of additional funds to the treasury alone. For further info on valuing liquidity and market makers, the introduction of this paper provides a good meta analysis of the research already available: https://sci-hub.tw/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2154699. I further argue the price manipulation standpoint. Using a DMM increases market depth and would actually make DCR less susceptible to market manipulation. That said, there are a lot of valid concerns regarding choosing a DMM which you have raised on Slack. There are many unscrupulous crypto DMMs out there (even some very well known ones). You have to really know what you're doing when it comes to the contract negotiation (namely, spread guarantees, uptime, and sizes shown at various levels).",82f197a914dd8bab17c341ea8a6e5d2de2d53efc04b0e63163c15163f663281b8f5c28cce729a1e8a48919f85ffdee2b0f5027720d78b3863316e173130ca005,58e6c6676b5b75f00ece826b63e185f961c3acb49319806d9f103f920190a556,24,95c05c8dcf47b28908824ce6296c88b0c24539f3e54d21d9ac472d2ec265f71b9607fd7ec34a5fead0d6aed0db34c6083171a1931ea5fab9044dabf269167200,1549563033,0,7.0,False,d48d0c18-82a7-499d-89e0-b5fa087bc58a,jsterling8,7.0

IMO this is a complicated matter because the points you present are valid. However they remain valid only when the objective is to maintain and foster the current ecosystem, with the same actors and incentives. 

Personally, I can't stand KYC, trading fees, and trusting tiers. I have years of bad experiences with exchanges, banks,  financial and/or CC services who are built with the only goal of artificially extracting more money from you.

The reason I got in cryptocurrencies is because I want out of this. I see every effort made to re-create the same structures and incentives as ways to hold back evolution and change.

At some point we will need a real DEX if we have any hope of changing these structures. And not the closed source, intermediary token, fee grabbing attempts we see now.

For me a real DEX would not be operated by a single party, would not require a single wallet and would be open source and possible to integrate freely in any wallet or app for any CC without requiring a central entity or fees and there would be no actors for regulators to potentially mess with and hinder functionality in the future. Unfortunately I have absolutely no confidence in any of the existing ""DEX"" projects out there to achieve this...


On the question of whether the Decred stakeholders should use the treasury to fund this project, we'll see how the vote turns out. The things I'm considering now are :

- We are in a unique position in this space that we have the ability to build a ""real"" DEX. If we don't, who & when does someone will?
- For how long can we go without a real DEX before it become a real issue for innovation? Or do we just accept past and current structures as inevitable?
- There's risk in using a sizeable part of our treasury.
- We are in a bear market and the effective cost would be higher now.
- In a bull market it would be cheaper but don't we wish there was a ""real"" DEX when the time comes.

I cited sources backing up that refutation because I'm intimately familiar with DMM and had them to hand.",1719dcb0c0314e5730495009672e3c3585890214af851d3013c8d4552d6c60ef5e47e057c0145624f30e6b9790ec4510e6dddd08efbbffc41a454b17eecb150f,58e6c6676b5b75f00ece826b63e185f961c3acb49319806d9f103f920190a556,29,413c0da867db176d12bc7654ef2550484340cfb8e21d834c60e729dfa23e79de64446a3ac7b2a8e7ae829f4f40ec1b0401d9946be9dfee16d87c7912de1ac809,1549614936,0,4.0,False,d48d0c18-82a7-499d-89e0-b5fa087bc58a,jsterling8,4.0

I do have a few concerns about a Stakeholder funded DEX in general:
 
### -**Relative Cost**
$100,000 to $1,000,000 at current rates is ballpark 6,000 to 60,000 DCR. At the high end, this is approximately 10% of the current DAO treasury holdings, or about 3% of the entire treasury subsidy that will ever exist. [treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx)

### -**DEX Landscape is crowded**
The DEX landscape is crowded. There is the Binance DEX, Blocknet, OpenLedger, IDEX, CryptoBridge, Bisq, Bancor DEX, Kyber, 0x, etc... I know a lot of these are semi-centralized, take a fat commission, require shit-tokens, are still WIP, etc... so don't get on my ass about it. My point is that the landscape is already crowded and is getting more crowded. 

### -**Concerns about lot size order matching**
This one is a bit complicated so bear with me. Essentially to avoid all the shady games that go on with centralized exchanges, the idea is to use lot sizes when matching orders. IE, say I put up 30 DCR for 0.006 BTC each, but someone only wants 20 DCR for 0.006 each, my 30 DCR would need to be subdivided into smaller lots to make the trade happen.

The issue here is twofold: price discovery is limited by the granularity of lot size, and on-chain fees could eat up smaller trades.

**Price Discovery & Granularity**
The resolution of price discovery is limited by both the order size and the minimum lot size. Smaller lot sizes and larger order sizes both increase the resolution of price discovery. IE, for price resolution of +/- 1% of a given exchange rate, you'd need at least one of the assets to have lot sizes of 1/100th of the order being placed (_well, either that, or accept that trades would occur at specific ""harmonics"" where the relative lot sizes of each asset matched the desired exchange rate_). This means that price discovery would degrade at lower value transactions, and leads to my 2nd point:

**On-Chain Fees**
If we do need end up needing transactions to be made up of many small lots to allow price discovery to occur, consider that all transactions will be on-chain. Especially for smaller transactions, this could eat up a significant % of the total transaction value, possibly enough to make the fees or commission on other exchanges seem more attractive in comparison. Especially if we return to conditions where Bitcoin (and possibly Decred) fees are considered expensive.

_TLDR_; I think it's a noble idea but I'm concerned it will be an expensive, low-volume, niche market for high-value transactions.

Anyway, that's my 2 cents. Curious to see what others think.",5e011eea3df9e82c4b40e8a0dc76ac6a04ebe0172d038b5794e532402f0981019a5e3de7a10b7b6771ef16f5d5f70ca4c797246343eab35668808b5e4aa3e706,561e590b88343c5ccb54b700ac686484cc392e656c66d1823842d2cbb37c0327,3,67bd0767f8816f61dfe6fd83e55f7560925d9d0b13772fac94af1d88e7d6d18a3b4b50f1b212c4ffcb72e50af47c11ed2579040202ddde73e5409ce54bb0470f,1549330338,8,9.0,False,f3e2ad05-6807-4805-a0dc-fcb8482b758a,solar,1.0

---

First off, to put things into perspective, the high-end ask for this proposal is $1M USD.

- At the current DCR/USD exchange rate of $15.75, that is 63,492 DCR. 
- Given the current treasury balance of 605,900 DCR, this expenditure would deplete 10.47% of the treasury.
- Assuming the current treasury block reward of 1.87804688, it would take 33,807 blocks, or 117 days - around 4 months (assuming 5mins/block), to ""pay off"" this amount. This does not take into account the fact that the block reward decreases over time, or the occasional block that doesn't include all 5 ticket votes (cutting that block reward), so the actual time period would be longer.

All these statistics assume that the market price stays the same (which it won't, though I won't speculate which direction it's heading). Given these figures, it's clear that this is a significant outlay of funds, and therefore deserves careful thought and scrutiny.

---

IMHO, the treasury funds should only be spent for two purposes:

- Funding the ongoing maintenance of Decred software, etc. to ensure that DCR does not loose its market value.
- Funding projects that will increase the market value of DCR, rewarding the stakeholders.

Clearly, this proposal does not fit in the former purpose; we shall discuss whether it fits within the latter.

I believe my view on the purpose of the treasury is consistent with sentiments that have been expressed on other proposals, especially [this highly-upvoted comment on the recent Baeond proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/f545b359fcf1b40b356e9cb556cb422cc7ff01b628b577f804cdc45ce414f5dd/comments/14). Quoting an excerpt from there:

> The treasury is not a venture capital fund, politeia isn't a platform to allocate grants. And stakeholders are not a group of investors looking to spend money on random cool ideas (even if they are really cool).
> 
> The treasury is a precious and fragile insurance policy. It's the energy source to keep Decred evolving, growing staying secure, implementing required changes, and staying relevant in the future ahead.

An exchange/DEX (however cool it may be), is not directly related to Decred (other than supporting it as an asset). I fail to see how this project will benefit Decred (or have a benefit of sufficient magnitude to justify the cost).

---

The proposal states:

> This improved exchange infrastructure will benefit Decred directly, by making the exchange process more permissionless, thereby increasing its accessibility.

How will this make buying Decred more accessible? Today, I can go to https://changenow.io/ and swap BTC for DCR without creating an account, without KYC/AML (in most cases), and have my DCR within 20 minutes. This is just one example, I am sure there are other instant swap providers with similar offerings.

This exchange promises only to support crypto-to-crypto swaps. Potential DCR buyers already have a far bigger hurdle to overcome, and that is turning fiat into BTC. For many people, that is accomplished via signing up to a centralized exchange, often doing KYC. For some, that exchange is an exchange like https://bittrex.com/ that supports DCR, allowing them to convert USD to DCR (albeit via two trades).

I am aware of the fact that the proposed DEX uses atomic swaps, but I fail to see how removing the requirement of trusting an instant exchange will make Decred so much more accessible that it will increase the price of DCR in a meaningful way (much less compensate the cost of the project).

The proposal further states:

> However, it will also benefit the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem as a piece of common infrastructure, which we can use as a marketing tool.

1. **Exchange via atomic swaps appeals only to a very particular demographic of traders — institutional block trading**. Why is a retail trader or proprietary trading firm going to use the DEX?

2. This DEX would essentially be a market data network — ****How is each node going to share market data from server to server at scale and globally?** How are prices going to be in sync in a distributed system across many time zones without one centralized server?
**
3. No high-frequency trading will be possible via atomic swaps — **High frequency trading provides the vast majority of liquidity in traditional markets - where is liquidity going to come from on the DEX?**

4. Understood that we want to disintermediate centralized exchanges and create a trading utopia without trading fees, but **we are forgetting that exchange fees have value because exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, etc) can use those fees to offer new services to appeal to more demographics of traders. Hence, at the very least, it is important for the DEX to be revenue producing for the Decred network fund**. The DEX could charge a very small fee that atomic-swaps into DCR and that fee auto-sends back into the network fund.

5) Lastly, **the DEX project is very expensive and DCR is on it's lows** — better to table it for now and sleep on it some more -- maybe bring it up again later when the network fund is in better shape. There are many other aspects of the Decred network to work on in the meantime 👍

Plus, many don't use DEX's currently and would rather wait until another DEX is accepted by the masses and use some funds to get listed there.  Or if no other DEX proves to be worthy in a year or 2 when the market recovers, we proceed with this plan then.  

I'd be fine with pitching in for a community DEX, but I do understand that would take longer and be more complicated.

I'll preface my comments with the following note; people tend to conflate the idea of the DEX with ""market making"" (which in crypto takes place in a very different manner than in traditional markets whereby liquidity providers usually make use of their own inventory), suggesting that all initiatives to increase liquidity are similar or that only one approach can be put into play.  I am personally a proponent of a multifaceted strategy, MM/DEX are not mutually exclusive and I would like to elucidate why a DEX will bring a degree of resilience to the Decred market that can not be replicated even by increasing the volume of DCR traded by one or more orders of magnitude on traditional exchanges.

Having DCR trade on a decentralized exchange which eliminates counterparty risk from the equation will bring a different type of liquidity and depth to the market that I believe very few coins actually have. A healthy order book will have tons of bids, many of them being ""lowballs"" (bidding for DCR at a price that is significantly below the last print). All that might seem useless but it is actually very beneficial and shows confidence in the asset.

Now say a user wants to bid for $1M USD of DCR (in BTC terms) at $5 (which is a steep discount to that last trade of $17), what that entails on a traditional exchange is exposing that $1M USD of BTC to counterparty risk, as the exchange can go under, be hacked, flag your account for ""suspicious activity"" and deny you access to your funds. In short, there are a myriad of ways which you can be screwed, even with the best centralized exchanges, making the most conservative way to use them  look like:

1. Send a small chunk of BTC to the exchange
2. Trade BTC for DCR
3. Withdraw DCR
4. GOTO 1

So you in essence only remove liquidity from the exchange and there is little incentive to be a price maker as the time your funds are exposed to the counterparty increases your risk profile. The strategy outlined above requires you to break up your trade to manage the risk, then rinse and repeat until you have acquired the size you desire. There is no reason to place bids or asks that are not anticipated to be filled in the immediate future. You are also likely to be required to go through the KYC/AML dance as there are very few exchanges that will allow users to transact without first being vetted.

Now putting on my investor hat for a moment another issue comes to the fore; having the ability to exit a position is even more important than the process by which you acquire it. Any investor worth their salt will want to be able to get an idea of what their position is actually worth. E.g., if you wake up at 3 AM and decide to sell, how much slippage will there be and can the market absorb your size? This is where the order book starts to become important. Even in the case of coins that do very healthy amounts of volume, it is quite evident that a great deal of the bids or asks can disappear at a moments notice when they appear at risk of getting a fill. In essence, many orders on centralized exchanges are placed by bots with no intention of ever following through with a trade, they exist solely to create the illusion of liquidity and trick the user into a false sense of security. These same types of bots are in many instances also able to take advantage of unsophisticated traders that place market orders, by frontrunning them (essentially acting as scalpers), but I will not get into that issue as this post has already become overly verbose.

So to put it succinctly, what a DEX buys us is a place where the actual health of the Decred market can be gauged. I have no illusions about massive amounts of volume materializing on day one, however I think having the infrastructure to disintermediate the centralized exchanges will put the project in a unique position to entice players that would traditionally not be adding liquidity to throw their hat in the ring, as the risks of participating in the market are significantly diminished.",0f140e75af29407d3c63df0269d212a8e23e6c497c54f2a252a8e7692bd3e868cf42a1be38ea44eceb9ebe63a8328a94ca879100ab5ba3e4f22e43366a3c0809,db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8,47,b8f6db5b930f953d46615ba09a600012c4f1996c0ae31e8b0896161a613afd3dbf17185b126066f6fcf05f72ddb9a88054954f88ab449375ff7f471846b33c02,1550462264,11,11.0,False,69934791-d575-44fc-9816-e7e58ff53726,jz_bz,

Correct. First step is to have basic client-server working, and later to connect servers in a mesh with shared order book.

(source)

I am not going to comment further regarding who has expressed interest in using the DEX extensively since it would be a violation of their privacy, IMO.

> How reusable this DEX tech will be for LN-based atomic swap trading?

Since LN is very low latency, I expect that the order matching algorithm might need to change.  The format of limit orders would have to change as well because they would not be backed by UTXOs, but rather funds stored in LN channels.  These are non-trivial changes, but much of the overall architecture could remain the same.

> Why do you think it makes sense to start DEX sooner rather than wait e.g. a year?

It will take a while to get the MVP ready, it will take several weeks or months to get some decent liquidity going, etc.  The sooner we start this process, the sooner there can be real progress made on the liquidity front.

> Is it possible/feasible to adjust the pace of work to market conditions? e.g. when market is bad slow down and spend less?

Yes, there is no reason this needs to be completed as fast as possible.

> Is it possible to prepare an ability to pause the project after certain key deliverables (""checkpoints"")?

I don't think committing to this is a good idea unless there is another serious dip in the exchange rate.

> What aspects of the proposal facilitate integration with existing trading actors? I assume open protocols, but perhaps some tools can be built to specifically ease integration job.

MMs can show up, setup shop, and the project and they do  not have to worry about counterparty risk at the exchange.

> How about time-locking orders so that they cannot be quickly removed? This could stop even more games and make the order book even more ""real"".

Making the matching process difficult to game, i.e. fairer, strikes me as fixing the most glaring problem with markets.  Overuse of cancellations of limit orders is obviously not a good thing, but I think time-locks would create on-chain bloat and go too far in terms of tieing traders' hands.

> There were concerns that DEX work will slow down other developments, and the rebuttal was something like ""the DEX won't have any impact on c0 roadmap"". Is it certain that c0 will not be building the DEX? Also, even if not directly developing the DEX I expect some review and coordination effort will happen to work with the DEX contractor - any estimate on that?

After some internal discussion, C0 could generate the engineering specifications without too much effort, but I am not interested in having us write the DEX client and server.  I would very much like to have a non-C0 contractor or group of contractors perform that work.

> Does the budget include marketing/PR expenses to promote the DEX, or will this be covered by Decred's PR budget?

To date, we've kept our marketing expenses pretty limited, with an eye to reaching audiences at trade shows and via trade publications and other media.  I would not expect it to be necessary to budget for marketing exclusively for the DEX.  Provided it has decent liquidity, it could be the subject of some articles in trade publications and other media, which doesn't create a large incremental marketing/PR cost.",10239d81c44bdd62015979dd564bc03f78344acbc9ed9ca23ebae85f27db0734febe00508955571fb8d916325418957464cb1bab88fe92fceb1173abe9e1b40f,e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360,61,73f736b3fb29eb47098560eeb362a2fc29878dcb588c733db7b21cf8acd8c77b82bedf32948242493f32c52d473bfae3a8e678df2fcfaef0527dc70d9a95c40f,1550632886,4,4.0,False,fe62dd6a-2cc6-4d41-abd0-522528d33ae7,jy-p,

Apart from that, I think its a good alternative to OTC trading which restricts my liquidity pool to

- Trusted parties

- Atomic swappers available via out of band communication, which is not private in sense of identity and transaction linking.

- Third party escrows and untrusted people, which increases the risk a lot.

I think this a very elegant solution that brings more privacy to atomic swaps by eliminating need for out of band communication and combines the liquidity of all willing parties via a single yet decentralized interface. To me this is strict improvement over current OTC trading.

As for competing with other DEXes or ""Why this DEX?"" question, i think it brings some unique properties to distinguish itself, as described in the proposal.

I am happy to see the reduced expenditure and MVP approach. Its good to build this in steps while taking feedback at every step.

Re: Expenditure Concerns - I think $250K is very reasonable for a lasting piece of infrastructure, especially in the light of other yearly budget proposals.

Re: Sharing of expense: I don't think its possible for us to force this other than by gating the listing with a fee, which is counter to the spirit/aim of this proposal.

My suggestion is to allow donations. I am not sure on How to expose it in the interface (maybe a prompt on download page for binaries/source code?) but it can be similar to how Politeia registration fees are collected and eventually sent back to treasury. This can allow for willing projects to share in the cost on voluntary basis.",84e22346883a633c9866279b01d1b3cde9ebed308a46b35903920723df86d4a072977cadc955a1e62407b0452adad9495151e333169b8c546ab5c91c6f4e8902,8b0efb1cdd09ced8194163ee0ea3b07f36c5507e90a02ca25a67bca9479448ee,72,a45882ec5d753ba0b8c1eb962a327afd8794843d4b0be2eb904f6e20d325b600bf4467c90dc30f860be41a15095d8cff5ffb5d0b27d09303c03154c1e383d001,1551810539,2,3.0,False,ea2f8305-cd17-48ef-9620-955f6f4de887,sambiohazard,1.0

What I was asking is whether server operator has the power to cancel a selected order during normal operation, kind of order censorship.

I think the answer is yes he can, as there's nothing directly preventing that. The orders are not stored on-chain. On-chain action begins only when orders are matched, and _then_ the server cannot stop the swap.

But indirectly the server operator risks its reputation because the order was accepted, signed by the server and broadcast to other clients. If multiple clients observe a missing order without observing a proper cancel order, it would be a clear sign that the server censored something.

If I got it all right, man this is huge.

The interface will be centralized, at least until the server mesh is in place. The swaps will be decentralized.

What I like about it is the same pragmatism so common in Decred. Fully decentralized tech is very challenging, complex and expensive.

Take Politeia for example. If the developers fanatically pursued full decentralization, we wouldn't be talking here right now. Instead they chose to get going with centrally controlled server _instance_. But the code, protocols and most _data_ is open, and the service is non-custodial, so overall it is _pretty_ decentralized.

Same for this DEX: server instances will be centrally controlled, but code, protocols and data will be open, and the service will be non-custodial.

> My suggestion is to allow donations. (...) allow for willing projects to share in the cost on voluntary basis.

Great idea! We shouldn't be too annoying with this, but we should definitely let people know that they can help by sharing the cost (as well as contributing dev/testing/liquidity/etc).

Here's the thing. I was totally on your page of thinking until something happened with my own little /r/bitcoinca community. 

The biggest exchange in Canada blew up. Leaving over 100K customers wanting for over 100 million dollars in crypto and fiat.

This was an echo of MTGox, BTC-E, Bitfinex, Cryptopia and will happen again, and again, and again, and again. until one day, someone cracks the decentralized exchange nut.

Decred deserves a crack at that nut, for no other reason than that [Dave is behind the proposal](https://blocktv.com/watch/2019-02-20/5c6d6a2be03e3-chain-breakers-promoting-constant-disruption-), and it's a nut worth cracking. 

> [In terms of Decred, our goal is to build something that has longevity and lasts. We have a subsidy so that we do not have to run out of funding. We were not ICO`d, we have no funds up front.

I think it would be very helpful for us to start thinking in terms of centuries when it comes to Decred. And part of that includes building infrastructure that could be used to exchange crypto to crypto, or even crypto to fiat derivatives if all exchange websites were banned by governments around the world at the same time. 

And I'm not saying this goal is going to be easy. And to take a quote from Kenndy:
> We choose to go to the Moon! We choose to go to the Moon...We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too.

In all likelihood the first implementation will be over budget, behind schedule, buggy, and blow up on the platform. The UI will suck, the user experience, terrible. But it doesn't matter! The ground work will be there for generations to come.

1\. Decred should not pay for it _alone_.

By definition, DEX means swaps with other coins. Why wouldn't they share the expenses? At least Sia could [be interested](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/7tfi0i/improving_the_exchange_situation/). Another possibly interested parties are exchanges.

Verifiable volume and activity is a huge long-term benefit for the credibility of the whole space. Decent actors should be very interested in this.

I suggest to do word spreading and negotiations work first, at least try. It could be a fund where Decred's Treasury is one of many participants with smaller amounts. If successful it can be huge.

2\. Expenses and Treasury.

Our expenses are up significantly, current burn rate is already $400K/month - please correct if wrong. In addition, $15 per DCR is not great and the overall market is poor, Treasury is under $10M now. If DCR goes to $5 this DEX alone would be a huge burden.

There is some merit in the idea that exchanges should pay money to cryptocurrencies they list (including Decred). Not because of who of them is more popular, but due to the fundamental fact that cryptocurrencies come first, exchanges come second.

Coins can exist without exchanges, but exchanges cannot exist without coins. Cryptocurrencies are more complex, require more skill to maintain, have much higher cost of programming mistake (whole network compromised vs one exchange compromised), while exchanges get hacked and lose money much more often. Cryptos embody the spirit of freedom and privacy while exchanges are primarily focused on making money, which forces them to obey sanctions and relentlessly KYC clients. The idea to eliminate trading fees by [Decred DEX](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a) is such a bold move.

Note that I'm not saying that exchanges don't bring any value to the ecosystem, they bring a lot. I'm just saying that fundamentally they are secondary to cryptocurrencies. Also note that I only mean serious cryptocurrencies, which excludes some 95% of the market.",08342abfe847188810567ddd9d24d33debcca94862d6042350c42d7c7f3e82cfe015f9b13441752156de52a63dcc38d38893170a29919346c9b75cfcc0dee90c,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,30,6e69ec2fb6089db25ad88d1d94be412993e76a3990eff937734724faf44ab4954d26d2df1dcf8ae05aa540967ec098e2d6d501cd8034e60bd015f80e0b18570d,1551519097,2,2.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

- People that want to buy Decred who need an easier onramp (e.g. someone introduced to Decred at a meetup who isn't that sophisticated).
- People that want to buy with a little more privacy (obviously this is determined by the selected ATM vendor's KYC policies).
- People that buy DCR simply because it pops up on the screen when they're buying BTC. I remember, for instance, being new to crypto, and buying LTC without knowing anything about it, simply because it appeared on Coinbase. That was a good decision. I don't think you're going to get the full on ""Coinbase effect"" here, but I do think DCR being on a platform with a wide reach raises awareness and credibility, and could lead people to buy a little just to speculate. 

I'm not in a position to estimate how much this usage will raise the price of DCR in the long run, but the cost does seem very reasonable considering the amount of work.

There are barely any in countries that are cash heavy and only 3 in whole of Africa, where people have actually shown inclination towards an quick fiat exchange with no other options.

Now that we have been listed on Vertbase and they are looking to expand in EU, i see very little to gain from getting onto the ATMs which are obviously less convenient option and probably a high risk one due to need of physical presence. Also if they do get any usage (which i am skecptical about) then it will just divert away the liquidity from Vertbase. I think if we can rather show enough volume on Vertbase, that is visible/reported at least as opposed ATM volume which as issac says was not available/reported, then we can make a good case for listing on other exchanges.

Apart from that many people have talked about, (anecdotal evidence from bitcoin) high fees/margins/spreads, privacy infringement via camera and non-working/missing ATMs while being shown on the map, as problems.

I think there is very little to gain from getting listed on ATMs especially at a price point of $10-20K.

I can promise you that building out DCR integration for General Bytes machines is a waste of time.

In addition to the reasons listed in my previous comment, here are several additional key points that voters need to consider:

1) **We are seeing ZERO demand from users of Bitcoin ATMs to purchase Decred. No need to provide something to users when they're not asking for it.**

2) **BTM operators will not list DCR on their GB machines because they don't want to hold inventory. Each operator only has a certain amount of USD-denominated capital to be used as ""float"". They don't want to take any capital away from the BTC float in order to purchase DCR, a coin that is very illiquid and that they do not know anything about.**

3) **Operators are cautious to list coins that have risk of being a security. **While it is believed that DCR will not be a security, the only large-cap coins that we can confidently conclude at not securities are BTC and ETH, and maybe LTC and BCH.

4) The vast majority of General Bytes machines are one-way ""buy only machines"" -- hence operators would need to purchase DCR in order to sell it to users of their GB machines. **Most Bitcoin ATM operators do not have access to DCR markets because there are hardly any DCR/USD pairs.**

**If you want this to pass... NEXT STEPS:**

2) GB machines use an optional exchange back end rather than have ATM operators hold inventory of coins.  There will be no steps required for ATM Operators beyond clicking the checkbox to activate DCR according to GB.
3) DCR to my knowledge is at nearly zero risk of being considered a security.  Have you done any homework on this?
4) Again, no, that is not how GB machines work.  Most of the alts setup, according to management at GB that have been working with us, use preferred exchange backend so there is no inventory for the atm operator.  I believe that is one of the reasons they are growing faster than Genesis Coin and will likely surpass their numbers within 1-2 years.  There would be an option to hold DCR, but apparently a very small percentage of operators on the GB network do this (although this information is not backed up by public data that I was able to find).

Next steps: 
1) I spoke with Genesis Coin numerous times in the last few months and they are not interested in doing an integration.

My biggest concern with ATMs is handling of personal data.

I'd like to see the privacy aspect clarified as much as possible for those who use ATMs and those who pay for the integration, which is not really covered in this proposal.

ATMs that collect KYC and biometrics contribute to the overall degradation of privacy of a given network/blockchain. More identities attached to addresses and transactions = less privacy for _everyone_. They are even more privacy invasive than exchanges that don't collect biometrics (yet). The collected personal data _will_ be shared with a cannot-be-known list of third parties. Worse, even if they don't share it voluntarily, a ton of companies have demonstrated their inability to secure their systems and lost data of millions of their users to hackers. By default I'm not convinced in any company being able to secure itself and their customers' personal data.

**Questions**

Do all ATMs take photo/video of the user's face?

Can General Bytes or other ATMs do anything without KYC? If yes, in what locations and to what limits?

Do ATM vendors have any commitment to not turn on mandatory KYC/biometric scans for all trades tomorrow? It would be sad to see the integration funded while small KYC-less purchases are possible, only to see it soon turned on for everything.

Do ATM vendors disclose which parties they share personal data with? Do they have any commitment to restrict this set?

Per the ""agreement with one of the recommended exchanges"", do ATM operators forward personal data to the exchange?

Do ATM manufacturer or operators have any commitment/obligation to keep machines running if the Treasury funds some of the work in this or future proposals? Do ATM operators have any obligation to enable DCR support pushed from manufacturer? If no, what do we do if operators refuse to enable DCR?

Who's responsibility would be to maintain Decred support in ATM software, as both it and Decred software evolve?

If there is any maintenance Decred side must do, what is the yearly cost estimate?

Is any control of DCR ATM uptime included in the plan?

Can one sell DCR via those ATMs, or just buy?",4c392b9b3cc2e5360194c05e327aeb924626ce1b7240cb3889767ed7300b7a85e9a5bd2343ac5305a2f4e3ac225f9bd0e46512b7c9ad0d26babe9c2e77233a00,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,37,508509b16244afd8a7b5d7b69044fcdb2069d7c5c7c4a192b84ac8f1d2036eb0826acb7a4df361c822967ac2e9bf2666d1019af3f034941fc385dfb5eeb86306,1553428076,1,2.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,1.0

-Users of Bitcoin ATMs do not speculate by purchasing cryptocurrency through ATMs.. The #1 use case is **money remittance**. You do not need any other cryptocurrency for money remittence other than Bitcoin -- the most liquid and wide accepted cryptocurrency.

-General Bytes is a second-tier BTM manufacturer. Genesis Coin is the clear market leader and most professoinal company. We do not want to integrate only with General Bytes.

-99.9% of BTM volume is BTC... there is hardly any volume in LTC, ZEC, XRP or ETH --> no one is going to buy DCR through an Bitcoin ATM.

-BTM operators are not necessarily going to list DCR on their BTMs when it is unclear whether or not it is a security.

Crypto ATM integration should not be paid by the treasury money. 

It doesn't work that way.

If the premium charged by the ATM when people buys DCR from it cannot even cover the integration cost, what's the point of integrating it to an ATM anyway.

I have to say I am delighted to finally see this initiative brought to a formal discussion.

Even though on the surface it goes against the idea of decentralisation, an aggregate site for the community to help them stay abreast of the most recent Decred developments such as articles, translations, events, and so on and so forth is a very welcome addition, as it will enable us to spread the Decred meme further and more effectively and will give current initiatives even more reach as finding them in one place would be super convenient, plus the original content stays where it is.

Would you mind clarifying, though, if the asked 6k USD budget would go towards building out the *under construction* features of the website, or to cover the initial bringup costs of the site (as in everything that made it look as is now) and then the running costs would be infrastructure costs + a hard-capped budget for keeping the site up to date?",429ea13905d9c6dc3b29653cd43f7e8f6d9c94198fde690d621e54fb48052bd5201c5ce6002bb5a5fccef905d140dfc453f0f225bc005fe5e22c9130c8ca2c08,c4a52c0cf07e9b57b162e8f1ee57583e8d69dea8267126152229d602df55ee42,1,e1e1b2d161107acabf3c9ee296858f0fba80726a5eb8a57b886f69f98b093ac3ac6644beb34337b8e96d1f89782f193cc42bd97532e596e957fa484b071c8a01,1550865252,1,2.0,False,b4a3e837-6636-41d7-bc2f-bc252fd961ee,kozel,1.0

To extend this time i will post a new proposal after 6 months. At this point it should be mentioned again that i don't intend to use the maximum budget! I'm currently assuming 20 minutes for adding an article (decred journal, decred digest, event-reports) with text formatting and pictures. At the moment it's expected that these articles will be available in 2 - 3 different languages. Decred contributors additionally write 4-5 articles per month, in rare cases they are also available in several languages. In addition, there are sporadic video interviews and podcasts from soundcloud. Realistically, i currently assume a maximum effective working time of 5-10 hours per month. In addition, there are server and infrastructure upgrades. Therefore, i keep a frame of 15 hours sufficient. I will only bill for the time i effectively work. So it could end up beeing less than this. I simply have to find out at this point.

The maximum budget is given because maybe there will be wishes for functional expansion in the future (stats page, timestamping service...) and act as a buffer for unexpected cases. Especially in combination with the marketing effords of the project there could be needs for cross-plattform campaigns. Maybe there could be need for a helping contributor hand on deadline deliverables. 

I will give my best to be efficient and keep my workhours low. I have always maintained this attitude towards the project and this will not change.

The placement of advertisements will not happen! No paid advertisements will be placed on the site in the future. If there are advertising banners, then only for project internal purposes and campaigns which are free for the project.

I could set a lump sum as it is done in other proposals. However, this does not correspond to my imagination, so i decided for an expense allowance after hours because i consider this to be fair.

I feel that lots of aggregation work is already done by Decred Journal. It contains all the recent articles, videos, podcasts and even relevant chats on comms platforms. This makes the utility of this site only marginal in that section.

On the other hand, i think this will lead to more individual content and take off some load from bee's shoulders. My suggestion would be to update the proposal to list content from different contributors being aggregated e.g. Pi Digest, Haon's medium articles, Journal etc.

I like the mirroring of basic infrstructure services. To be sure, these will be independent instances of these services and not just links to the current instances, right?

You mention a Newsletter service, is this the same one that is proposed in [2019 Marketing Plan](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e)? If not is this not replication of same service and its costs? How will this be different?

Good to see, although voluntary and unpaid, translation work will be co-ordinated via the site.

Apart from above, I have three questions:

- Is this going to slowly replace Journal or both will keep working in parallel?

- What is meant by private and public photo gallery and areas of the site? can you explain with an example what these areas will be used for?

- Why can't this be added to main decred site under say community.decred.org? What are the benefits of doing a separate site?

Access is granted to a selection of trusted contributors in the event of a failover/emergency. I would like 2-3 people who are able to make backups of the site and place content on it. Currently haon has access and he was introduced to working with the backend. If my response time asks for this situation due to an emergency or vacation, they should be able to tune in and post new content online. In this case they should be balanced out of this budget. What is important to me is that they are trustworthy and know what they are doing, what an introduction requires.

Writers are compensated by the Treasury and publish their articles on various platforms. I think if the project has paid for the production of this content, we should publish it on different platforms and not just keep it on individual platforms. I don't intend to manage the author's activities! I want to give them the opportunity to publish their content on this platform. Also for visibility and censorship resistance to what has happened in the past on the medium with crypto related content producers. I expect decred's main page to be more selective about the content they will publish, as the purpose of the main page is to inform and be more official.

I have spoken with various contributors from the field, both in chats and on meetups. The idea was welcomed and I started working on the proposal a while ago.

The site should only serve as a platform for the output of the decred community. It should not replace anything, it should complement! It should inform and motivate new people to participate in the project. You should keep in mind that different target groups prefer different ways of presentation. Showing presence only on Github or the main page may not be enough.

Basically, every content financed by the treasury should find its place on the site, but not only that. Therefore I don't want to limit myself to certain sections (pi digest, haon, richardred, journal) (see section 'what'). There is no reason why these sections should not be supplemented in the future. Contributor profiles, author profiles, voices of individual stakeholders on certain topics, all the things that have no official character can find their place here.

Infrastructure, of course, are independent instances, this also emerges from the proposal (see 'ongoing budget'). We will use the ressources that the server has available for these.

Concerning the photo galleries I noticed that there are already a lot of pictures of conferences and meetings. These should be displayed clearly instead of being scattered on twitter. Visitors of the Meetups should have the possibility to find each other again. Regarding the privately accessible areas, there was a desire to provide materials especially for investors and the press.

The main page is informal. A horizontal diversification in the external presentation of the projects should enrich the ecosystem. As I said, I expect a rather conservative attitude from the main page in the future, the outsourced community page can only enrich here.

* Proposal presents a working prototype.
* The prototype looks solid and is immediately useful for all the content it has already organized.
* The fact that the author built the prototype upfront with his own money shows that he is passionate and will likely actively work on it in the future. This is in the spirit of Decred.
* The budget is fair, if not modest.
* Content tagged by People and other categories is a powerful way to navigate.
* Blog that aggregates multiple authors, video and audio, future events calendar and past events reports, list of merchants, architecture for multilingual content - are all long needed. I have a ton of designs for these, but they barely progress as drafts. Glad to see someone took it much further!

### Not liked

* The voting was rushed after just a few days of discussion. Combined with mostly secret development it gives very little time to think and discuss. Since the idea is sound, in case this voting round fails I suggest to not give up, adjust and try again.
* Web fonts abuse. With web fonts and SVG disabled all icons are missing. This is my personal thing, normal people don't have this problem.

* How private content works?
* Can photos have metadata like pictured people or event it was shot at?
* Will it support RTL text (Arabic, Hebrew, etc)?
* Are there feeds to subscribe for and follow certain categories of content?

### Notes

* If anybody could spin a mirror of this website (see Knowledge preservation above), it removes most (if not all) centralization concerns.

* [dcrweb#579](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/579) is applicable to community website too.
* The site can be built from multiple smaller data projects useful on their own, e.g. merchants data can live in its own repo and be consumed by the website's build process.",f26a035a7966734fbe495f500d960a92c2659862e9a9cbe057836077dc8d6d41cc341b0ec2f171f9a1616f2ad74b80214bea230274660a13fe767e31ec0b1704,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,54,7dbccbfb2544d249d82a0efaa059edcd97a54ba02425638bcaf501faed4f4b6ac88689246bc945770362620657f33958be97ab8bfd310b5befb017fc4e30f005,1551379195,2,3.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,1.0

Knowledge preservation:
- *Can I clone and sync all site content?* 

No, only chance currently would be to download a static version or see next answer: 

```
wget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites --no-parent http://example.org
```

- *Can I selectively clone and sync only low-footprint textual articles?*

Not yet but will be available via RSS

- *Can I run a mirror of the website?*

No. Would mean you got the database, which includes logins to the cms backend.

-*What formats are used to store content?*

XHTML - has a rich-text-editor at the backend, no coding needed.

-*Will it mirror video content from YouTube to protect it form destruction?*

Thinkable but not planned. Each video would have to be served in 3 different file formats. Could be generated serverside with ffmpeg. A lot of storage would be needed, maybe an additional mediaserver would make sense in that case. From frontend side it already supports local served video, but is not in scope of my proposal.

- *Can it consume raw Markdown?*

Yes, converts to XHTML when storing in sql database.

- *Governance: how content is curated? Is it possible to change or remove content, and how?*

CMS backend editor. I will create 'submit forms' for the different sections in the front-end side. Everyone will be able to suggest/submit content that have to be edited, reviewed and published by admins/editors in the backend.

- *Track record: is content versioned?*

No. There is only a report on activity of the admins in the backend (what content/code section they touched when), but no versioning/old versions of the articles/changes.

Features:

- *Is non-js experience high on the priority list?*

Yes. Non-js experience at this point way better than dcrweb ux. But for some things js is mandatory, like video or soundcloud player, gallery- and slide effects.

- *If this is paid by the Treasury, there will be no sponsored content, no ads and no third party user tracking, right?*

Correct. Either way, there will never be tracking, sponsored adds or other kind of stupid things of this kind.

- *Will site usage stats/metrics be public info?*

I have deactivated all of this serverside. I am not interested in that crap. I would agree to embed piwik-visitor stats chunk of the decredproject. Marketing could work with that internaly, i have no access to this.

- *How private content works?* 

If there is need for this from the marketing team it could be available. Various approaches are thinkable. User login based with different access level/roles, or simply a simple single page password that protects content.

- *Can photos have metadata like pictured people or event it was shot at?*

Each single photo can have an individual title and description. Images are organized into photogalleries/folders, currently each event has one. I will work on the Event Detail page to show Event gallery, report, videos etc.

- *Will it support RTL text (Arabic, Hebrew, etc)?*

Yes, supports RTL. From backend side no limitations on languages/lexicons. If at some point someone steps forward to redesign the page, an RTL version css for the frontend would have to be provided.

- *Are there feeds to subscribe for and follow certain categories of content?*

Prototype already supports this. https://decredcommunity.com/site-map Click on the RSS icon. Can be made available for every section granualy. After i am happy with the deliverable i would start to work on an RSS reader Android app. Got a concept in the drawers.


Org:

- *How long did it take to build the prototype (tech and content)?*

I realy have no idea at this point. I did it in my freetime and did not track my worktime. I started the concept back in November. The marketing proposal was a surprise and so i rushed a little to put the prototype proposal up.

- *Do you know (have you negotiated with) people willing to curate content?*

No negotiatons. Was getting help for the landing page from noah. Displayed the site in different stages to contributors i have met on meetups and discussed ideas. Others have already stepped forward to help with lexicon (site/lexicon/allaround navigation) translations.

I will create 'submit forms' for the different sections in the front-end side. Everyone will be able to suggest/submit content that have to be edited and reviewed by admins.

My plan is to work things out and create roles (content creator, editor, publisher) for different sections/translations on the backend side. After that there would be the need to create introduction videos on how to work in the backend for those different roles. By time it would be possible to grant more people restricted access to their area of work. This could be done once the site and their sections are build out but is a process to be planned in the future. At the current state it is simply a one-man job and my experience with scaled multilanguage cms based website is, there is a learning curve involved in working with the backend and you realy want to seperate creators/proof readers/editors/publishers(remove). Nontheless i will grant 2-3 people admin access for emergency purposes, like i already have mentioned. Having a solid multi-user/role setup takes planing and coordination. It is very granuarly. Therefore i want to build the site with functionality out and when i have streamlined it introduce new people potentially.

- *What is the overlap with dcrweb (e.g. newsletter)? How do you envision cooperation with dcrweb? Any ideas to avoid duplicate work?*

I am not planning to create newsletter content. I already answered that question, newsletter functionality is strong in the framework. It could be used to organize and publish newsletters, it could just be used for subscription(unsuscribe, multi topic selections/lists, optin functions etc.). The marketing team has to decide this. Either just a .csv with un-subscriptions or as a full blown newsletter service.",0e81b279154bd3d2edf289124771da06a6fe4de7313b718b33d8d5be49619055d90cbd413154071e1fe85ace84f385a1a1a23b31a3a18f0bd494b84f4ce4740e,e0e3133b3d628b5975dc30151aa9e1c66491595d90a84f5fde5a2ef5edb4d831,56,b93e87b31021ed700be3eb5f73352ecc5aaf1918f60924d2218c75b7638bbd26c948f6a68df26c0f3ac0aa4cc0a03de15b321ec520f67454328aae0908da240c,1551391902,3,3.0,False,596e75b6-1037-4402-9470-ff99639a08f2,karamble,

> It is build on a open source cms, runs php and mysql

What about site's own source code? I mean any custom settings of the CMS, custom code, scripts, Docker, etc. I mean a public repo like [dcrweb](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb) or [dcrbounty](https://github.com/decred/dcrbounty).

> wget --mirror

Ahhh... I did a ton of wget and I absolutely hate it. It is brittle, unreliable, slow and inefficient. After initial download is done, it either gives no incremental sync at all (because most sites suck HTTP-wise) or needs to HEAD every damn URL on the site (can be thousands) to grab a few new pages.

I was hoping for something as robust and fast as `git clone` and `git fetch`. This is why Decred Journal is a [git repo](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news) since day one - you can grab it all in a blink of an eye and sync it later in another blink. Anyone can anonymously get a full local copy of the data and read it offline. If I go to vacation, disappear or go nuts, anybody could quickly host a mirror without searching those couple chosen guys I shared backup keys with. What I'm looking for is git-based content repo like DJ but bigger, with multiple authors. Now I see it (indestructible knowledge repo) is completely different effort and doesn't overlap much with the website, whose primary purpose is to aggregate everything in one place. In fact they could work together.

> Can I mirror? -> No. Would mean you got the database, which includes logins to the cms backend.

So the data is not open :(

To clarify, I'm looking to replicate content only, without logins. Perhaps it can be separated somehow. Having public content mirroring interface (git, rsync or similar) would be awesome to protect content long-term.

> XHTML

Source of truth in XHTML is better than HTML I guess, but worse than Markdown imo.

> video hosting not planned

Got it, so it does not overlap with [file archive](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/26).

> Is it possible to change or remove content, and how?

I guess the answer is yes, admins/operators can just remove it from the database, with only a few admins possible seeing it in the logs.

> metrics

When an article has the comment function enabled you introduce more pita and possible inconsistency.

I guess with the right path it can be anonymized and dockerized, but this is currently out of scope.

Regarding HTML - articles could be styled and formated in a more complex way, they could include floating images/text layouts. Keep in mind that not only .md files or github repos will be the source of contents here.

Regarding STATS - that stuff is currently all disabled. The cheapest solution is to run awstats that ships with apache. I am absolutely not interested to run any stats at all.

My biggest concern with that stack is centralized data lock-in. Static sites with full source and data on GitHub like dcrweb or dcrbounty can be fully cloned by dozens or hundreds of decred fans without permission. This is not the case with this website.

Your suggested measure to share backup keys with several trusted community members is not ideal, but is a workable solution.

To be more resilient (and relief my concerns) I suggest to:

* Increase the amount of ""data backup"" people to 4-5.
* Add at least one ""backup webmaster"" person who could reinstate the site from data backup in your absence. He can also serve as one of ""data backup"" people.
* Publicly secure commitment of the above people to make periodic backups and help to restore the site in case of emergency.",7c3fdd5d574157c3dfbaa0413a841ee3e2c390d5f4c4fd832b23708a0323b5bf86a10b9c835fce3ce5fe27e0e81b3c2c3bc06c2bc410aa46e3c87b305e6f3f08,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,59,b15c315c335197492da5863071de5c00132747c06319b9b60e503d6cccc33bcdca4fdd9e87e65606c1b6efac85770d4aadb5af732cf9775548e21ea0a3d0f905,1551517378,0,1.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,1.0

I don’t see much proposals approved and rejected on Politeia, especially from marketers, and I’m hopeful that I can add value to the network with my proposal and potentially inspire many others to do the same with their own ideas.

$750 not fair for 3 videos? I’d like to challenge that seeing how this price was determined and adjusted by Decred stakeholders and the support team. A majority of the responses so far have said this price is reasonable. 

I’ve researched the free videos for Decred Tutorials on YouTube. The videos I’m creating were chosen by determining what’s NOT already done along with seeing what I can do better. From my perspective, my detailed walk through videos are much more user-friendly, especially for novice users. These videos will be valuable because a) I will complete a FULL SET of tutorials which will cover the most important topics chosen by the community, b) I will walk people step by step as if they are looking over my shoulder, c) I will help people AVOID specific mistakes they can make in the process like not using a password manager which tends to be overlooked and undiscussed, and d) I will make fresh content for Decred made in 2019. I find it highly relevant to make updated videos since user interfaces change regularly. 

I agree that content creators will undoubtedly make more tutorials covering all different aspects of Decred and many will do them for free. However, since Politeia is big part of Decred, I suspect that these same content creators will pick up on the fact that they can actually get funded to do these videos and will prefer to take the Politeia approach as I am doing. I did the free videos to show my skills and seriousness. The additional videos I’m proposing to do is difficult for me to justify doing for free. I hope that’s understandable. Plus, I am proposing to do these 3 videos in under 1 month versus the unpredictable time it will take for someone else to make free videos on similar subjects which may or may not be as complete as mine. 

Also, I like the video you shared. I’d like to challenge your notion about this type of production being the ONLY type of videos stakeholders finance. My suggestion for stakeholders is to fund all types of video production including documentaries, promo/ informative/ intro videos like the one you referenced, detailed walk throughs like mine, daily or weekly video blogs, interviews, presentations online and in-person, and etc. and not be limited to one style.

To be clear... Yes, I will walk-through how to create a Politeia proposal since it's very easy to do. However, my intention is to go much deeper than that. 

The recent updates for Video #3 state that I will: ""Explain to users step by step how to make a proposal starting with the guidelines for putting together a proposal, discussing it on Slack, posting it on Reddit, editing proposal based off feedback, finalizing proposal and submitting it, and getting community support."" 

Let me know if you think that’s appropriate or not to include in Video #3 or if you think it deserves a separate video. Since Politeia is about proposals in general, I feel like it is appropriate to include in Video #3 because the video will appear too basic without it. 

Because low quality proposals get submitted, my intention for Video #3 is to teach people how to make high-quality proposals in general (not just how to submit one) and create a basic standard on what’s expected. Therefore, Politeia will attract more high-quality proposals along with users who know how to use the entire Politeia user-interface.

* Ownership transfer of content to Decred.
* Fair budget.
* One revision per video.
* How the author handled criticism and incorporated feedback over multiple iterations.

Concerns:

* Complete beginners may be not the best target for Decred
* The requested budget is low and nice, but I think the cost of collective attention spent on deciding such a small expense is way above the expense. I guess it's okay now because Marketing 2019 is still not approved, so no certainty about its budget. In the future, I think it would be reasonable to include small things into a bigger budget.

Questions:

* Will these tutorials educate people to stop using insecure OS (Windows, Android) or bad habits of keeping funds on exchanges?
* Linked [Decrediton tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rWLI_pC0d4) doesn't include a critical step to ""avoid getting hacked by bad actors"", which is to verify signatures. This is the only way to make sure you get the software unaltered, do you plan to cover it?

The unfortunate reality is that computer security and privacy is a rabbit hole.

On the highest level you develop good habits of attention, discipline and hygiene. You learn to find the right domain, check secure connection, verify sigs, backup seeds and not leave funds on exchange. Also useful are habits to not install random software on the device that stores your keys and generally minimize the amount of code it executes.

Depending on the amount of money in question, at some point it makes sense to also consider an operating system you use. Windows devolved into total anti-privacy garbage in recent editions. OSX looks slightly better, but after multiple incidents like [empty root password](https://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/7g738d/anyone_can_login_as_root_with_empty_password/) oopsie or the [FaceTime](https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/28/facetime-bug-hear-audio/) oopsie, Apple stuff looks questionable. The rabbit hole goes deeper and deeper, down to the Intel spy chips conveniently installed in majority of modern laptops, and finally to horrible architectural CPU bugs present since 90's.

At some point we might have generic [security guides](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/101) that could be useful outside Decred.

I see that your tutorials are targeted at people at the very beginning of the rabbit hole, and helping them to develop even couple good habits would help them avoid most silly losses and be of huge value to the crypto space.",a498060679ac0e9a8ebdff4d057bf620760781047e72d6361165d70ce3e0134e1e2dd489fb0bec620a40fc48bd84b2f2fe5c6e5c49c5832adc0ecaf019c2c307,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,32,6c3da7eaabdde2be7ff5ab7561bc1da9076baf8e07b20eff9edde6dda2b9fe8d3c095b3b54a364c2801c35252242d1ee7b05583d1d075fde496ef5a3cb53d00d,1551365239,1,1.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

It seems you are trying to **take advantage** of DCR's Development fund, especially by asking for $750. 

These types of simple tutorials are generally done by Youtube content creators **for free** (as you did with the 66 other projects) though they get paid by ads, donations, and affilliate marketing so their work is not really for free. I don't see why Decred stakeholders should finance something like this.

As Decred grows in popularity we will _undoubtedly_ see content creators make tutorials covering all aspects of Decred.

Stakeholders should only finance such videos if they are high in production value, something like this:

I also find the asks for the various components reasonable based on my past experience on related projects (although at this high level I'm making a lot of assumptions).

For clarity, this vote is currently for a 220000 USD equivalent in DCR budget for planned activities and 70000 for potential new activities, and would operate as a budget (where only actual cost/hrs are paid for activities and there is shared responsibility to end the year at or below the target budget)?  For example, if only 10 of the 20 suggested community members get local events rolling we might expect the end of year spending to come in at approximately 50,000 USD for that line item rather than 100,000?

a) It looks like you have made the manual process unfriendly for independent contractors. There is no dearth of contractors willing to work provided the system gives them the chance.

Dash pays contractors upfront via blockchain- while this may not be the best way it certainly ensures an open, encouraging and democratic system. 

b) Because of a) we are going to be forced to handover large funds to one or two core team members which is a pretty limited pool to select from and smacks of centralization. This would in due course lead to price gouging.

I think we must keep in mind that decentralization will not happen instantly and it was never expected to. Most of the elements we see in this proposal are for types of work that are already being done and for which funding was allowed from the treasury by the DHG during the last 3 years.

I don't believe either that this proposal is the ""final level"" of decentralization that we hope to achieve. This proposal is however a clear shift in transparency and an important transition from the DHG management of the treasury. The key word here being ""transition"".

I also have a few concerns regarding the content of this proposal, although I understand the complexity of shifting how funding is managed and the implications for people already in place and currently at work.

From my experience when you have people who do excellent work, are productive and autonomous in your team, the last thing you want is to micro-manage them. Rather, you want to trust them and let them strive for greatness because that's when you get the most out of them. 

My first concern is on the timeframe of a full year, I would hope we eventually turn to more frequent and standard periods (like quarterly) for most stakeholder's budget approvals. I say most,  because there are a few domains where annual review would certainly be enough and make more sense. As we are in uncharted territory here, a year long period is a safer, although slower transition IMO.

My second concern is regarding the grouping of multiple elements in the same proposal. It does make sense for a marketing plan as a whole, but it does open the door to having more difficult votes if some elements are more ""controversial"" than others or if stakeholder see less benefits in an item.

For example: To me the Decred Assembly, Newsletter, Website updates, Podcasts, and Internship are no-brainers and budgets are within what we would expect of quality content for these types of work. For the other elements however, it's a lot harder for stakeholders to decide if budget is adequate and to envision what actual work will be done. I would be much more comfortable with a shorter timeframe for these elements.

As a side note, I could see future proposals presenting a year-ahead plan and budget like this, but requesting ~quarterly payments in follow-up proposals where stakeholders can evaluate progress and actual spending. That would most probably alleviate my concerns, and leave room to adjustments if needed, while keeping a way for increasing/lowering budgets or adding/removing elements, if conditions change during the year.",d1a1e96fd8e825de8c53290117085c84d798b97b40a506acab70bd2870b6f79e8000f73d658ae52bd02a205853424f90dc9a4a7f388fe4fc6a88a2f1090b0f0f,0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9,13,4648096edb9d02544f6edf1e1dfe3865763632952788b7b9ae03cc0c07bdacc76036b69f3d0f53aa75bb650fc0918d27b0b2acc7f0be128009df272fbab0a808,1550896526,12,12.0,False,3ffa2992-ace9-4a7d-abce-51872469e765,nnnko56,

If I'm wrong someone can correct me,  but this proposal would not hand over the total amount to an individual or put someone in a deciding position.  It's the exact opposite....

My understanding,  is that all work described in this proposal,  would be billed at an hourly rate by each community member to the upcoming DCC platform.  (Instead of the DHG). In the DCC platform, contractors in all fields, review work being done by their peers before payment is made. The goal is to eventually see all those steps including payment, automated, with no manual intervention in the treasury from the DHG.

This change explicitly remove gatekeepers to the treasury while giving autonomy to contractors, and ensuring peer review of every little detail being worked on (without involving stakeholders in micro-management of daily hours).

This method is a clear step towards removing individuals from power position, and having the collective stakeholders and contractors, manage this decentralized organization efficiently. It will definitely be harder and (eventually impossible) for someone to ""run with the money""  after those changes, than it was in the last 3 years.

Also, as all work need to be billed to the DCC, costs represents the total budget cap allowed by stakeholders and not the actual payment directly given to each person involved. If the work done and validated by peers on the website, end up to 40K$ at the end of the year,  nobody will have the possibility of leaving away with the remaining 25K$. Work still need  to be billed to the DCC and reviewed by peers before any payment goes out.

All parts of the puzzle may not be in place yet,  but I believe it's where we're going.

I think the key thing here is people should see these proposal as moving away from DHG to multiple contributors who manage different domains like marketing, events, development, research etc. I think that for future these types of proposals should be presented as ""Proposal for Marketing Management for 2019"", as this is clearly what it is.

We have seen a natural hierarchy develop in most areas where some people are more dedicated, experienced and talented and eventually start co-ordinating activities and other contributors seem happy to look up to them for guidance and advice. Some examples are bee(data management/information gathering), dustorf(Marketing), richardred(Research), davecgh(cryptocurrency fundamentals/programming & education). I think this is decentralization at work, devolving power away from one entity (c0/DHG) to multiple individual/corporate contractors.

It is exciting to see new people come in and fill the gaps. I think although people will balk at the term middle management but that is what has emerged naturally over time and we should probably formalize it with such transparent proposals.

At the very least, each section should have a further breakdown on costs. 
This should be a rule for Politeia. For instance. 3.5k per Decred Assembly. How much goes to the studio? If the figure is above 2k, understandable. If it is less than 2k, probably not. The point is you have to be completely transparent and not vague.

The same goes for the website and supplementary. 65k and 70k.

I don't think it's appropriate to share my wage, as that's an invasion of my privacy and it will not be shared under the DCC format. I will say that my wage is a fraction of what i would be paid if I worked for a corporation, and like many contractors, I'm billing for fewer hours than I work. Additionally, I was part of the project for many months before receiving compensation of any kind, and only received it after jy-p instructed me it was time. 

My first contribution to the project was a user survey (shared in chat last May), which coincided with a key stakeholder survey and competitive analysis. This yielded a positioning strategy, which lead to the process of finding and vetting a PR firm, which [I detailed in this extensive blog](https://medium.com/decred/pr-in-politeia-process-progress-and-pitching-in-d88771183dd4). I then hashed out the messaging, seen [here](https://pastebin.com/E5L6u2RV), and I have been managing the PR engagement, which has seen Decred be prominently featured in Forbes, Fortune, Breaker Mag, Coindesk, and more.

Regardless of whether you agree or not with the proposal, please consider these points regarding the payment process of contractors following a proposal. (I've made some effort to dig up this information and confirm my understanding of how things works. The chat can be seen in the #proposals channel on matrix/slack). It was also agreed that the information is not readily available atm, as we are switching to the contractor management platform.

- This is not a proposal where the full amount is to be paid to the author like smaller proposals we had before.
- The author will not personally manage payment to sub-contractors from the requested amount.
- All work being done in the context of this proposal (including the author's time and contributions), will be billed in the form of an invoice to the contractor management platform)
- Work billed to the contractor management platform is reviewed by peers (other contractors in the same domain. i.e: coders review work by coders, etc..)
- Work is paid in arrears only, after review by peers.
- No payment can be made from the treasury with no reviewed work regardless of if there is budget left from the initial request.


The process described here is so that we now transition from:  The DHG reviewing work before pay, to contractors reviewing peers before pay, and does not involve centralized control of work review by the proposal's author.

This proposal is for stakeholders to decide if we allow the marketing plan described here to go forward, and have each contractor listed, begin billing for the authorized work to the contractors management platform.

Your concerns about transparency are legitimate. I just want to add a little context from the perspective of Decred contractor working in another domain, with no relationship to Dustorf. 

**a)** Decred contractors don't work here for the money. I don't know how much Dustorf makes, but I know I could make much more money elsewhere (was before I started working here). I took a massive pay cut because, like most, because it's a meaningful way to make a living. Part of that is not being micromanaged and having some privacy. If the stakeholders force more transparency and a negotiation around pay, contractors pay will likely go _up_, not down. I'm open to that conversation actually, as I believe better ""price discovery"" will allow the project to pay better while delivering the same or better value. But know that privacy and autonomy are a big part of the ""compensation package"" that allows stakeholders to get stellar talent on the cheap. 

**b)** re: jy-p trying to be the ""CEO of the treasury"", I sense that's been somewhat true (though to be clear, I don't have insight into this process). As far as I've seen though, this is common in any crypto project with a real budget. Some centralization is necessary at first, then projects decentralize over time. What is important is that there's a real commitment to decentralization and a plan, not just words. I would argue the fact we're having this conversation here is evidence of that decentralization happening. Before, this budget would just have been approved by jy-p and other ""insiders"" (again, don't know the process, but I'm assuming it was fairly centralized). But now, the power to approve budgets has been moved to _you_. Stakeholders _could_ vote this down. And further decentralization is continually discussed and planned (e.g. the DCC). The long game is to have funds literally managed by a smart contract, no humans. If you want this machine to keep going though, IMO you can't move too fast, or you risk good talent leaving the project because they don't have enough financial security to stay even if they wanted to (we're not all crypto rich, able to go long a volatile, risky asset with every paycheck). 

Again though, your concerns are legitimate. And moving the conversation forward. And inspiring me to spend half an hour writing this even though I can't bill for it.",8561f92a9a5ebc7a9b7e68cc985e02b7c48396178d8e87b83e97b44aca2cda0d99e6e3328cba4670fae53de6a81a2efaa6026680869618a52bef6fff76f83c01,1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73,40,87824ebe9d61a8bfe36f530179061218e77406b71925ac9b30604212b35bb902773ffe9857e00f6de24f475c9967a11bd7e82b6892444d6745dbcd953f70ba04,1551212138,6,6.0,False,107efb48-3ab1-4830-8b69-35842ca010de,s_ben,

It's perfectly OK to vote no to this proposal if you believe there are issues with it; some people are doing just that. There are also people who are probably confident enough in voting yes, solely based on the track record of past expenses, as the treasury has grown to a sizeable amount during a period where the DHG really could have run with the money, but didn't, and delivered instead. If we were able to know exactly who voted yes or no and to which amount the system would be broken and a privacy risk  for all stakeholders. The idea is that instead, we know for sure that those who vote, do so proportionally to how much stake (risk) they have, regardless of who they are.

Regarding disclosure of personal information, personally I would fight any initiative stripping away privacy from anyone involved in Decred (contractors, devs, stakeholders, users, miners, etc...). Or straight up sell all my holdings if privacy was removed by design. Decred aims to be a decentralized organization not a surveillance agency.

That argument fall short also if you take a common organization like a company, the hours / salary of every identified employee isn't public information.

It doesn't prevent people from reviewing work and expenses.
It doesn't prevent someone to get fired if he's not delivering.
It doesn't prevent shareholders from approving/refusing budgets.

Sure it's a different model entirely when your goal is decentralization and there's no central planning entity,  but keep in mind that until we're replaced by robots, we're still dealing with humans, privacy and trust.

a) $65000 is a very expensive for the amount of work speced out without much clarity on actual payrates. 

b) Community Organization plan for $100,000 without any small scale experimentation looks very suspect. This should be started small and proven. Better still, teams should approach decred directly without going through gatekeepers. Giving this budget to one person means creating unnecessary power centres and should be avoided at all costs. 

b) $70,000 in funds for an unspecified cause is a complete no-go for me. You should let the treasury decide this, otherwise what is the whole point of pi?

Same. I got much more on my previous job for a corporation.

In Decred it is a challenge to maximize the billable fraction of time spent here because there's just so many interesting things to do, but you only get paid for useful work.

Founding teams misuse their votes and position to grab all resources (or give it to chosen ones) and control the project by proxy. When they are accused of this, they will say, bring proof  that they are controlling the votes (knowing full well nothing can be proven).

* What is the reasoning of not bundling this together with Marketing 2019, and why some meetups and quarterly events are part of Marketing 2019 and not this proposal?
* How do you feel about the ~$400K spent on events in 2018? Was it worth it and why?
* Is there (or will there be) a breakdown of 2018 events expenses?
* Based on indirect observations I always perceived Consensus as a money making machine for the organizers. Note that events are completely not my domain, I'm just curious as a stakeholder. iirc Decred was on one Consensus before, was it worth the ~$50K and why?
* I would love to see Decred in front of [CCC and FOSDEM](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/83) attendees, they might have a ton of engineers for whom 'sovereignty' means something. Is facilitating those in the power of this proposal?
* Reporting was a common omission for events. There was very few reports, a lot of talks were not recorded, the information was not nicely organized. Now that event expenses are brought to stakeholder ratification, it is reasonable to agree on reporting schedule. Ideally, for every event there is someone responsible for producing and sharing a report that would include (or link to) a text writeup, total expense and any recorded photos/video/audio. Ideally, all reports are organized in something like decred-events repo, while large media materials are self-hosted on some file server.

* I broke apart the Events from the Marketing Proposal because I didn’t want to present too much in a single proposal. Events were a primary tactic of Decred last year, so it seemed like a natural split. I’ve broken out the local meetups from these events because the meetups are done more autonomously by community members across the world. These events are slightly more centralized, as they’re planned by the Decred team in Matrix, not simply any individual who wants to coordinate something for Decred. Based on the input I’ve received on each proposal, I might propose more than two to break out separate, chunky ideas as their own proposals.

* As a disclaimer, I was not involved in the event decision making process last year, and I was only involved in the planning for WebSummit. I understand what was done and why, and I believe there are certainly areas where we can optimize our presence. I’ll speak to those later, as you ask explicitly in your last question.

Last year, the project had stronger purchasing power and event attendance was strong. It’s easy to see why the decision was made to attend the events we did. Whether it was worth it is an interesting question, in part because there’s no counterfactual we can point to. I’ve seen many of the benefits myself when I talk about events and marketing plans for 2019 in that these events have brought our community members together, expanded our community, and enabled cooperation. Examples:

At NABTC in January, 2018, the Decred team met Sid Maresh, who is now, more than a year later, helping to organize the San Francisco community with regular Decred meetups. The first one is March 6, 2019 featuring Luke Powell and the Placeholder VC team. This is a strategic area rich with devs fluent in Golang. There’s massive potential to add devs, expand the community in a strategic location, and bring more contributors to the project.

In 2018, Decred attended events across Europe, enabling communities to form that have become autonomous. The UK team and the Polish teams have formed bonds and are working on behalf of Decred without the need for centralized coordination. I propose one large event per continent, in large part, to enable teams to form that can operate more autonomously in their region.

* Expenses for the 2018 events were given to me as a single, lump sum approximation by jy-p. I would bet that he prefers to spend his time on new features rather than old accounting, but that’s up to him.

* Consensus is likely the most important annual event because it attracts the right people. Relationships with individual contributors, developers, media, other contributors and potential partners in the ecosystem, media, and strategic partners matter. It’s the single place everyone congregates, and the face time we get is where we can help solve challenges such as a lack of liquidity, lack of awareness, and so on. Trading volume was extremely high around that time, and the value of Decred was extremely high, particularly in relation to BTC. It’s not the place you’ll find bee, but it has value to the project.

* CCC and Fosdem are definitely in play. In the past, I’ve attempted to get traction for Fosdem and GopherCon, but the point of failure has been the unwillingness of Decred team members with strong technical skills to attend the events. It’s only developers who can vet other developers, so they’re a necessary component. If you can help facilitate their attendance, I’m in full support.

* Events happen, but it’s critical to maximize the value and the legs of the events. We can do this through reporting, which can help us improve and optimize our presence and spending. Heyvj has established a method for documenting events [here](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/wiki/Event-Report-Template), which I’ve contributed to for NABTC, and which will be a standard practice for all events covered in this proposal. These should be completed within one week of the event.

As you mention, events generate content of two types where Decred can more strongly convert upon going forward. The first part, you mention is video content. When Decred representatives speak at events, they demonstrate authority on a topic, and we would like to propagate that as much as we can. I believe we can leverage that content both on YouTube, as well as our updated website. The second type of content we can leverage is simply imagery related to the events. JZ has brought up the idea of always having a designated photographer at an event to document things. This helps yield social media content in real time, and also contributes to a digital asset repository that has multiple benefits, including for media coverage.",58e93b0fbb0e02698addaa604f9f11edae1d0ee79787d8c90c6a8799549649d5eecacdf6840a862600644e5fe473b63b9f862f30df348d2fb60c3be32c850608,2cfe1335346e419a3f00fc3672c1a53ebcc1c15f48d3e9e174af7356be14bc5a,14,231c9370ece084e52ceb22722f390e70e5dd61657945f7e8bdc07d8f22c89d3d349d6d1d70ecb85a8affcfe312affaa172c419ecdeeeb2927ac572b288021502,1551286212,1,1.0,False,c2adc10c-375d-4399-a4b7-0fbbc827034d,dustorf,

I am not perfect myself, but I'd implore you to deploy empathy & think harder about the human at the other end of your keyboard. I think it's pretty apparent that we have a full team who have all put immense effort into the project to date and for you to suggest that we think Decred is a charity we can just sign up for when we're ready to make it rain is a straw man argument at best. As you'll start to see on the vlog as episodes go up, we've been working on this proposal for ~two months. It would be much appreciated if folks could read the proposal thoroughly enough not to need to be informed of its contents later, after having already responded. I also think the juvenile nature the #proposals room in Slack exhibited was...surprising. It was unbecoming of the team, and not what I would expect from the only crypto network with working on-chain governance in production. (since 2013!!)

We're here in good faith to take and integrate feedback because we believe in the ethos of Decred, too! I can certainly appreciate a bit of sticker shock; making games is expensive! We really think that setting an example for the games industry to turn their gaze our way will propel Decred & the entire crypto ecosystem further forward at faster pace than we've seen to date. As I say in the proposal, a high tide raises all ships: we are stronger when we work together! We do not consider ourselves a private business any more than Company Zero was at Decred's inception, and we intentionally only referenced the Airdrop & Fairdrop plans, imagining myriad more models would be suggested by the community as some helpful folks have!

We've found when studying the crypto space in macro that games are how the rest of the world is looking toward the space to prove its worth and spur mass adoption. (everyone here knows sound money is reason enough, but most need more than that) Some game developers are interested, but the space is still so nascent that many of the major concepts are still so obtuse, and games don't yet support or even understand the infrastructure to support them. To reference [Dani Grant](https://twitter.com/thedanigrant), [platforms follow the application](https://www.usv.com/blog/the-myth-of-the-infrastructure-phase). We have a long view; Baeond is dogfood for a larger Proof of Play protocol that we anticipate will enable industry veteran game designers to create permissionless & autonomous games. We're here for the long haul and think Decred is the wagon to hitch to.

We possess an agility Decred does not when it comes to experimentation, so we're looking to join forces and grow alongside, not unlike how MimbleWimble/Grin has been handling [forks](https://mw-w.ink/leer/index.php/flavors/). Someone in the Slack made the comparison to this prop effectively being a satellite dev team Decred would be funding, and yes! That's exactly the ticket! We don't see any value in shouting at the team to support features we'd need for a game & we don't see a lot of promise in other base layer projects just yet. The space is ripe for experimentation! We want to help start a more nimble arm of development around Decred. We really don't think anything could be healthier for the Decred network at this stage in time. 

For now, I'm updating the prop to reflect an ask of 11K $DCR disbursed over 7 months. I'm working on a quick writeup for the end of the week on some of the specifics of we're doing to support LN swaps with DCR, NFT support, a Politeia facelift/UX breakdown(Hi, design team, if you're reading! I'll be reaching out to you on Github soon!), and a few very new, very untested ideas we look forward to putting through their paces.

However,  asking the Decred stakeholders for funding is not a good idea at all. I believe many recent proposals exhibit the same issues as this one.

The treasury is not a venture capital fund, politeia isn't a platform to allocate grants. And stakeholders are not a group of investors looking to spend money on random cool ideas (even if they are really cool).

The treasury is a precious and fragile insurance policy. It's the energy source to keep Decred evolving, growing staying secure, implementing required changes, and staying relevant in the future ahead.

At the moment, the primary question that anyone who want to make a proposal should ask beforehand IMO is:  Who is the primary beneficiary of this proposal? ""  If the answer is not Decred or the Decred ecosystem, or the Decred Community,  expect strong opposition from stakeholders..

That's how I view the treasury and its purpose. That being said,  I could envision within a few years, when things are going nicely and we have a better picture of our treasury and operation costs, a proposal being made to set aside a small % of the treasury specifically in a separate fund that itself,  could be used to allocate grants, donations, or to fund various ventures like this one.

While Baeond may end up being a very cool game, I don't see how it directly benefits the project, beyond it integrating DCR support at a later date.  There is no existing network or service, so this is effectively funding an idea/vaporware nearly from scratch.

Historically, the project has only financially supported development of open source software.  Will this game be entirely open source?  That is unclear to me after carefully reading the proposal.  Funding closed source software development creates serious transparency problems since work cannot be verified prior to payment of monthly invoices.

I think it's neat that they plan to use DCR's hybrid PoW/PoS consensus algorithm as the basis for their chain.  However, I find the entire ICO model to be questionable, both ethically and legally, and by funding this proposal, we would become entwined with it, per ""after the crowdsale next year"".

Others have voiced this same concern: it is not clear what Decred gets in exchange for DCR 11K (previously 13K) in funding (roughly USD 200K).  It appears that the promise of Baeond coins being airdropped to DCR users is the main return from this investment, but I see no quantification of how many coins would be airdropped.  Further, the model here appears to be ""in exchange for objects with established value (DCR), I want to sell you a promise"".  I see little utility in using the Decred Treasury to fund such VC-like dart-throwing, and we have limited recourse in the case they do not deliver on their end of the deal, i.e. the airdrop.",5ba6f1b49fceb70f36f022471aa647fd93a2d11657ed9f7ba5f827ff00038ceef9701f687021fc41dd166b991d55062d0ad705dc490fb7da3c4d9af86cd7b105,e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360,16,d12d15a4d81a8baf26e293055bf3d0e8bb1a1ab74f8b81b3256d54bf281c40ebb50f22046a1b2857269c2c35140a0914b92fd4d2bd6dc57f1169a98c2e9ae307,1546435917,9,9.0,False,fe62dd6a-2cc6-4d41-abd0-522528d33ae7,jy-p,

I'm not sure what you mean by this. Do you mean every different wallet that has held at least one voting ticket throughout Decred's history?

I don't think Decred stakeholders will vote for a proposal that aims to pay individual stakeholders back with card packs, in any case. The Treasury is not an investment fund and payments are not intended to generate a return for stakeholders.

Baeond seems like a cool game and it would be great to see you develop it using Decred as a foundation. It is not something the Decred Treasury should fund, in my opinion, because it asks for a significant sum of DCR to do things that are not well connected to the project's objectives, and which are unlikely to deliver significant value in that regard. $200k moonshots are not the kind of signal stakeholders should be sending about the (still young) Treasury's aspirations.

IMO, this proposal, just like the previous Decredex proposal from the same user, shows a total disconnect from the project, the community, and the principles on which Decred is built upon.

1. The treasury isn't meant as a bank from which to fund your personal ventures, business ideas or experimentation. If you are to convince stakeholders to approve your proposal **you will need to demonstrate clearly how it would benefit the project** and not your business. I'm sure at some point stakeholders may be inclined to take some risks on innovative ideas that have clear potential benefits but maybe for now, it would be best to **consider stakeholders as being very conservative and careful in their spending**.

2. **Technical words have specific meanings.** If someone doesn't grasp the meanings and concepts behind those words and attempts to use them in an amalgam of tasty selling points on a checklist, it will fail miserably. The Decred community is composed of  extremely talented devs who have been in the space for years, hardcore fans who take to heart to stay informed, and stakeholders who have money at stakes, which means for them, making the best decision is paramount. If you want to bring meaningful words like ""decentralized"" to the discussion, you better make sure you understand what it means and what are the implications of these terms in the context of your proposal.

3. Being a technical community; claims of profit, market valuations/predictions, investment models, and general claims of ""future popular trends in cryptos"", will most likely be seen as vaporware and distractions. The main selling point of a proposal for building software in this project should probably **focus primarily on the direct improvement to the project** you expect, and on precisely how it will be implemented on a technical level.

4. The community will vote! If you do not engage with the community prior to posting a proposal, you do not gather ideas, and advice, you do not verify basic support and interest beforehand, you are deliberately reducing immensely your chances of seeing your proposal go through. To take a bad example: **Don't be that politician, whose name you see for the first time, on a ballot.**

5. Words are not enough to prove your capability. **The bigger the proposal, the more you will need to convince stakeholders you are capable of doing what you say.** Decred being open-source, show past contributions to this or other projects (emphasis on verifiable source-code). If you want to work with current devs, actually work with them and make sure you can get the DCC (Decred Contract clearance) and simply get along with other contractors in the project. It's sad but not everybody is cut-out for open-source and blockchain development. Ultimately, **you cannot expect stakeholders to blindly take a leap of faith** that everything will ""work out"".


As a summary, if you want to contribute, maybe taking the project as an example would be a good start. You are more likely to gain support by underselling/over-delivering. Technical accuracy is mandatory. Put forth smaller, solid blocks to build foundations within this community, rather than showing a castle of cards.",7810b868694f2e9017183bf9e975658e0e633818c566c84455c6b35ad53e7c22e527bc0832e5d693725743848d47a73f90df511843c098728f455c8540e29b05,0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9,2,cd6a23f00fdb9ea66daee6f4cee7418800202596dc8f1d437ed536392dc62d79cdb1505f2c639d94f077aea35c0e23f2438f417c5e2f81a1f59888259a532c04,1543987139,7,7.0,False,3ffa2992-ace9-4a7d-abce-51872469e765,nnnko56,

If you're just looking for a short response to this proposal, just read his comment and stop reading mine; it's long.

Seemed easiest just to quote the entire proposal with my comments inserted; here goes:
> # What
> 
> **USDD stable coin**
> 
> **The joint company - between REUM and Moentum have created a USD-backed token.**

To be clear, has this token already been created? If so, links please?

> 
> **USDD** - is a stable coin built as the currency which can be purchased with crypto (all established exchange coins) or fiat (debit card or bank transfer) by users, **REUM** seeks funding to complete the stable coin GUI, which allows users to purchase stable coins to be backed by **Decred (DCR)** as remeedable upon the USD value, each USD is pegged 1:1 to each **USDD**. 

So is REUM starting an exchange to allow the purchase of USDD, that's going to support ""all established exchange coins"" & fiat? Is the development required for that included in this proposal, or is that separate? Or is this promise contingent on [Decredex](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/e78bc28631d0e682912e3ece25944481bf978b906ea44b1ed36470c0f48b27fc) being funded?

Also, let me get this straight: USDD is backed by DCR, but pegged to USD, am I right? What happens if the USD value of the DCR backing USDD goes down; how is the peg retained? Also, who holds the DCR used for backing USDD?

> # Why
> 
> Our in-house studies has revealed stable coins as the main cryptocurrency technology for us to concentrate our efforts on in 2019 and our external online research referencing to a report, entitled the **Cryptoasset Market Coverage**.
> 
> Outlining a number of predictions for the virtual currency markets. 
>
> *The report assets that over 90 percent of “cryptoasset value will be derived from penetration of offshore deposits in the next decade” and it anticipates that such a state will propel the market capitalization of all cryptocurrency markets, according to* **Satis Crypto Market Predictions:** 
> 
> **$500 Billion** in 2019, **$1 Trillion** by 2021 and **$3.57 trillion** by 2028, while 90% of crypto currency asset value will be extracted from penetration of offshore deposits in the next ten years, stable currency is about to dominate the development conversations around digital currency over the next year.*

OK, I get it, a lot of people think stable coins are the next big thing. There are already quite a few: Tether, Dai, TrueUSD, USD Coin, Paxos, and I'm sure I missed several. How will USDD be better than these existing solutions? In other words, why yet another stable coin? What's wrong with the existing coins that USDD solves?

> All **USDD** on exchanges will be backed 1:1 with **Decred (DCR)** and valued pegged at USD, providing an obvious route to 'in-house' digitally implemented store of value provision for **DCR**, during harsh market periods and the peg will allow **Decred** to become part of the new securities market emerging within cryptocurrency. **USDD** with merge the **Decrediton GUI** for the USDD stable coin wallet solution.

Again, still haven't explained how that peg holds when DCR goes down in value.

Also, you're proposing making changes to Dcredition, which will certainly require a [Decred Contractor Clearance](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4). Has anyone from your company obtained a DCC? If so, please list those individuals.
 
> **USDD** is redeemable for USD, simply by entering your wallet address into the **USDD portal** and upload your USDD currency to get conversion back to fiat or to DCR, any verified account that passes the USDD industry standard KYC/AML check is legally entitled to redeem **USDD** for USD.

Who will be running the USDD portal and enforcing the KYC/AML standards?

> # How
> 
> **Decred** will provide **USDD** with an immediate paid up collateral model for the asset backed element of stable coins – it is a hybrid model based on a simple mathematical formula 1:1 to 1:1 pegs for value and asset.
> 
> - asset backed by **DCR**
> - value backed by USD
> 
> Every **USDD** is always fully collateralised by paid up capital as value pegged to USD and asset tethered to **Decred (DCR)* in the unique use from the standard stable to fiat coin model, our stable coin uses DCR to keep the currency true, and pegged to USD to allow simple trade calculations, profits are created by arbitrage from payments, but also from **USDD** trade, which brings further revenue while we assist as the blockchain layer of bank services.

You mentioned profits; who makes the profits? REUM or the Decred Treasury?

Still waiting to hear a clear explanation of how this peg really works.

> **Decred Politeia** funding will provide new developments related to algorithmic stability, AI/ML and KYC embedded into the smart contract and the currency directly (meaning each coin/token has a separate ID, bank friendly and regulation proof currency), also traditional market solutions for mortgages, cross border payments, remittance, escrow and clearing services.

Decred does not have turing-complete smart contracts; only simple Bitcoin-like script. How in the world are you going to do KYC with bitcoin-like script?

""regulation proof currency"" What does that even mean?

DCR already works fine for cross-border payments; and escrow is already possible with 2-of-3 multisig. Why reinvent the wheel?

First off, this Bank Token. Bank Token has a webpage, but isn't listed on CoinMarketCap; has it launched yet? Also, the Telegram group has a total of 9 members, and is basically a ghost town (mostly posts from Fabian). Not what I'd call a success. Why will USDD not suffer the same fate?

Decred community is a broad group; can you be more specific? Also, Telegram is not bridged to the main Matrix/Slack/Discord chat; so that's not the preferred communication platform.

You have an exact figure here; does that mean you've already negotiated with them? Can I contact them to confirm you've spoken with them regarding this?

Why do you need a special blockchain oriented voice solution? What's wrong with existing generic solutions?

So is there one office, or multiple offices? How many staff members do you anticipate? Also, $20k is on the low end for developers, I'm suspicious of the quality of work you'll get for that rate.

Are you buying a new electric vehicle every year or what? How in the world do you come up with the ridiculous price of $35,000 per annum? Maintenance costs can't be anywhere near that high. Or are you buying a brand-new Tesla with a payment plan? Also, who gets the car at the end of the 4 years?

Currently supported coins did not provide any founding for few reasons:

1) This was a first batch of currencies. Now wallet is usable so you can check it out before making any decision.
2) All coins other than BTC and ETH were a low hanging fruit that were added because tools and providers I use support those, now each extra coin would require an extra effort.
3) Those coins did not have a voting/proposal/treasury system. I really love the idea of a community driven project and I was actually advised to post my project here to see what happens.

Your concern does make a point though and that's why I tried to keep it reasonable.

Oh, and I want to warn early on that dcrstakepool may need to be treated differently, at least to start.  It was supposed to have gotten love from the operators, but alas, the open source mentality is not too strong when there's competition it seems.
I know for a fact that when critical bugs have been identified in the past, certain pools had mysteriously already patched themselves for a supposedly newly discovered bug.
Expect people to pop up and demand money to port their fixes.
That's the idea I guess, but we should be aware there might be a flood of this kind of thing for dcrstakepool
I'm referring to bugs in the past that can do things like crash the process, or eat CPU.  AFAIK, there aren't any severe hacks

On the content,  I believe this is an horrible idea.... GPUs are more vulnerable to large ""Chinese"" mining farms because there is far less risk to build a GPU farm than using ASICs.  With a GPU farm you can change the coin you mine as often as you want, and even resell the hardware for it's real purpose (gaming). You don't really have skin in the game.

With an ASICs farm,  you can only mine one coin, you cannot resell easily, the risk is higher to get stuck with that hardware. You are quite a bit more invested in the currency you mine.

Maybe the only moment that argument would hold IMO is when a coin is already exclusively mined on GPUs and a new ASIC could be made in secret and take over.  However  in an well established coin like Decred where we have multiple ASICs manufacturers and a strong governance system which can keep miners in check I see this suggestion as an immense step back in security.",42014516845f978fef58ff9e1b3963006fb2e3d8191803cf865087af251c3cbd1171528ebf19a759389f9444b0eaceec1d1811e6621b92dcd5568d685b5f200f,0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9,2,b63c6ac83c325b6cfcc47ec43d1b9d9a27bfebf9156f193dc76eed4b598cdd552a3ab537819fbdf52869d7cc439397e088636dfd35ccd98a391e138c5cbfb603,1542045691,10,10.0,False,3ffa2992-ace9-4a7d-abce-51872469e765,nnnko56,

1-No algorithm is truly ASIC-resistant
2-The coin emission rate depletes at a rate that makes early holders diluted anyway
3-PoW attacks are harder to pull off since it needs PoS validation anyway

Because of the hybrid PoW/PoS system, it's roughly 20X more expensive to 51% attack, according to recent analysis. This means ASICs pose less risk. In fact, there is a strong argument they increase security, as the increased hashrate they provide, paired with PoS voting, increases the total cost to 51% attack. There could be a possible danger if there was only one or two ASIC manufacturers mining in secret, centralizing nearly all the hashpower. However, the Decred team, perhaps seeing this danger, signaled that they were ASIC friendly from the start, resulting in like half a dozen (or more) ASICs from different manufacturers coming to market, leading to decentralization within the ASIC mining community. 

Also, while I appreciate that this important issue is raised, it seems clear to me from Decred comm channels (slack, telegram, reddit, medium, etc.) that the vast majority of the community is ASIC friendly.

Right now, tickets cost around $5k, which is out of reach for many potential new community members, just as ASICs are. But with ticket splitting coming online, that comes down to around a couple hundred dollars. This could in effect make Decred the lowest barrier to entry ""masternode"" (though that term is not exactly accurate, it's close enough). Masternodes are a big thing now, especially as the bear market wears on, and people are searching for more steady returns. Once ticket splitting is officially integrated (and it appears it will be), this could be a killer marketing angle to drive new community adoption.",93c90558d90e6a7cd6b8009dfe8eeedaa2c855d2e36a8130c2a39196baf05e0b2dd30d1333d63befbe7ff50e1d6f87ab23e7bc547be8992da1f1a1476fdef400,5122d5762113077bd2968b5b99f826ce54eaa52e72d0c93620351225dabd08be,7,43ee09f565c40e01690aa4205617282efa0afe772d855572e947b9892a634ffdeef303e9be0ec1a8771436072eb27b83eac6f916fc78ae54eb6739a057038704,1542481454,1,1.0,False,107efb48-3ab1-4830-8b69-35842ca010de,s_ben,

* Machines: ~2000
* Fees: $0
* Marketing Requirement: None
* Deployment Type: Push
* Developer Responsibility: Decred
* Process Provided: Decred would be responsible for development of the wallet installation by forking/modifying the open-source repository.  GeneralBytes would ""backport"" the wallet to existing machines.

* Machines: ~1000
* Fees: $0
* Marketing Requirement: None
* Deployment Type: Pull
* Development Responsibility: Decred
* Process Provided: Decred would be responsible for development of the wallet installation by forking/modifying the open-source repository.  Decred would also be responsible for contacting ATM owners to suggest pulling the updated software or purchasing our own ATMs to release with the Decred software.

**CoinFlip**
* Machines: ~200
* Fees: $10000
* Marketing Requirement: 3 months of cross posting
* Deployment Type: Push
* Development Responsibility: CoinFlip
* Proess Provided: Decred would pay the $10000 fee to cover development and deployment.  CoinFlip would develop and push the wallet to existing machines.  Both parties would agree to run 3 months of social media promotion.

I have additional requests for information pending.  My recommendation is that we get more information as a community and take a pragmatic approach to ROI and market penetration.  Note that this information is based on initial emails with marketing managers and verification would be needed before an RFP or new proposal submission.  Based on limited information so far GeneralBytes is a strong ATM contender.  Any community experience with GB or other ATM providers?

From the proposal I understand, that generally at Bcash a Coin interested has to pay commission to be listed on your ATMs and that Decred will only be added to a limited amount of ATMs. E.g. those currently existing and deployed in the near future, but not on further ones. 

Hence, with this proposal, Decred would:

1. Pay for the implementation
2. Keep paying for maintenance 
3. Pay for being listed on future additional ATMs
4. But not receive a cut of the ATMs earnings

?

It sounds like Decred will pay for a part of your business without receiving a share. 

Besides, I dont like, that this proposal would open a continuous position in Decred's balance (fee for maintenance for the following years), with losing all benefints on cancellation.

The coins are significantly marked up to begin with, then the ATM takes a trading fee.

1. Yes, we have worked with Bitcoin.com, HoriZen (ZenCash), Monero, and Dash. On top of that, we have worked with MANY crypto businesses and crypto accepting businesses. We got in early and are considered to be a market maker in that segment. 

2. No telling. Advertising is an art, not a science. We are audio. We don't have click-through rates. This is the biggest problem with audio ads: they are hard to track. Also, I imagine these as branding ads, not direct response. Branding ads are intended to create a reputation and keep your product top of mind. Can you think of a jingle for a product from your youth? If you can, branding was successful. 

I can guarantee that your ads will be heard on 190+ US radio stations, 2 satellite channels, dozens of streams, get 100,000+/monthly podcast downloads resulting millions of listening sessions per month, but I can't give you any kind of results, other than many advertisers stay with us month after month. 

3. The show is heard on many platforms. The biggest are radio and podcast. Neilson rates radio listening and that is how we get our estimates. General numbers are available on the Internet, but we don't pay the $30k per year for the use of the more specific numbers. I can give you screenshots of our podcast downloads 

4. We are A LOT less expensive than any other Top 30 radio program that I have ever seen. Like 1/10th as much. Like I said in the presentation, we did well and don't have to take advertisers that we don't want, and we don't have much of a sales department either. So, our rates are low, but we are making enough to keep broadcasting. So, things are fine. 

I just did a quick google search on underwriting costs for NPR. It looks like you can get a nice web-banner on their site (No on air presence at all) for the cost of this package. I don't know if that 20 grand would get you a banner for a month or a year. https://www.nationalpublicmedia.com/get-started/

FTL is the best value in advertising, especially if you want to hit males in the US. 

4. Ditto is a PR firm. Usually PR firms attempt to get you interviews, they don't place ads, generally. That is the job of an ad agency. I have lots of critiques of ad agencies, after 20 years in this business. We can talk about that too, if you want. :-)

This proposal is for a full radio/podcast live ad package which includes 30 second recorded audio ads promoting Decred to our national and international audience.

As for this proposal, after reading, it seems too expensive. FYI, I think we have spent too much on marketing already (*I voted NO for both PR firms*).

Also, having a PR firm already, any additional marketing side-efforts will affect how we determine the impact/benefit of their efforts.

John, thanks for your questions. There are 2 main ways to listen to the show: the live version and the recorded version. The Live promotions are at least :60 seconds in length, and are part of the show, as opposed to a recorded ad. So, they are heard on both versions of the show. The :30 podcast ads are heard in the recorded version only. The :30 second radio ads are heard in the live version. If you wonder “Why not have the ads that air in the live version just air in the recorded one too?” The answer is that podcast audiences have a much lower tolerance for ads than do live listeners. 

Obviously, these numbers are estimates. Because of the way that radio listeners are quantified (they are counted by the 15-minute listening segment, not by the 3-hour radio program) we can claim millions of listens per month. That isn’t a perfect way to count, but neither is by the listener. A listener could be a person that listens to the whole show on podcast, on the treadmill at the gym or it could be a mom in the car for 10 minutes with screaming kids. The short answer to your question is about 250,000 weekly listeners. We don’t count daily because different days of the week have different audience size.",d627dd9da5ee54ead25b952177f7a307f4d06d37fd6490c825acecc83cc79a93399bd0af5f14d038d16d81a79cbe50af134e7d66e89873be2221dbb53da2d406,b719b0bee46a2fb08a1d31f5b81577f886c1d51707da860645757ea28cc19e03,25,751a2d8b132eef73cdbfef079434b3a3818db5afcc451af86f703b6f8dbee7d8b086bc9530f90904ca3744e61c89a1ad725827c3ca85f30852bc846f8ca76103,1543960135,2,2.0,False,be19e500-e8ff-43f7-a7db-a4c93b643cde,ftl_ian,

There are some inaccuracies here. Yes, we had a DASH proposal. We advertised them for close to 2 years and then they began focusing on Venezuela and we parted ways. The DASH proposal expires this month, but it went live months ago and they are not currently on the air with us.  I was clear in my responses here that DASH HAD been an advertiser. That is what we do, we are a radio program and we sell ads. DASH’s slot is available and we offered it to y’all. There have been some months that we get 85% of our revenue from crypto. We are a show that is friendly to crypto. 

Yes, the price is different from the previous DASH proposal because pricing for crypto has gone down recently. If it goes down after this proposal is approved, we still will provide the ads that we offered at the price we promised. 

Yes, we modified this proposal from our DASH proposal. Why is that bad? It is a good proposal that lays out our Major Sponsor proposal quite well. You can find our packages here: https://www.freetalklive.com/advertise. 

If a car salesman sells 2 different people the same make/model and color of car, I don’t think anyone would call it a scandal. 

Regarding Smartcash: That IS NOT an active proposal. It was just me seeing what they would have to say.

Here is what Liz Bagot (Ditto AVP) posted in Slack regarding this proposal: 

> The question was put to Ditto in the marketing channel, and I wanted to post it here as well. We've been asked to weigh in on the radio proposal in Politeia, and here's what we think:

> Generally, we recommend an integrated approach in which we know the message, who we want to say it to, and where those people are. Maybe it’s radio, maybe it’s not. If you’re going for broad awareness, it may make sense down the line to go for a broader radio play. However, we think paid advertising is premature at this stage — we have yet to work through Decred’s branding and messaging, which we need to nail down and make airtight before we approach the broader public. For the sake of putting on a solid public front, we need to agree on how best to tell the Decred story and position ourselves, both internally and externally. This is the first order of business for Decred’s work with Ditto — and what we’ll be discussing with a couple Decred folks this Thursday. We recommend focusing on getting the free earned media stuff first (which Ditto has already started). Once we’ve established a strong external narrative, we can consider how and if paid opportunities might complement our efforts.

So with this feedback, I am willing to vote no for now, but wouldn't be opposed to this proposal in the next few months once Ditto has done their work and we are ready to spread our message to the masses.

Implementing this proposal in the current form is against what I perceive as Decred ethos. But I do like your contributions to cryptocurrency, your audience and your network. Full length shows and interviews, or even commentary, would be great to broadcast.

Long version below.

I very like concept, but not the format:

> Per show, this means Decred receives three (3) :30 second recorded radio ads, one :30 podcast ad and one (1) live promotion per show. For the recorded ads, we’ll use different voices. This, we feel, helps function as a sort of “Word of Mouth” campaign. Listeners hear the same message repeated by many different people.

This is my biggest concern for this proposal. 30 second ads sound like cheap shilling. What deep, thoughtful information can one squeeze in 30 seconds? I don't want to see ""Decred ads"" or even ""promotion"". I'd love to see full time shows and interviews that explain why Decred is so amazing, e.g. ""Decred is one of the few places where you can have real sovereignty"". I don't want sovereignty to be packaged into a product that can be sold in 30 seconds. Using different voices for 30 second ads makes it even worse, it sounds like mind manipulation. You can't fake a ""word of mouth"", and if you can, I don't want it that way. Sorry this sounds harsh, but when reading first time it raised my eyebrows so I wanted to share what I feel.

I'm also not sure about the banners because I hate all ads that interrupt my thoughts, and always filter them.

That said, I do like the concept of using radio in general. I cannot verify all claims, but if they are true I am thankful and respectful for doing a big contribution to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency movement.

What would be great instead is to have full length shows and interviews with our community members because they understand and can explain Decred well. There are a lot of topics to cover like sovereignty, skin in the game, conflicts of interest, aligned incentives, forks, ASIC resistance, misconceptions about PoW energy usage, ICOs, Politeia's resistance to manupulation and more. News from Decred space would be great too, we have [quite a lot](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) going on! Another approach is commentary on what happens in the space.

The only short ""ads"" I would tolerate is announcements of the shows so more people don't miss it, e.g. inserting ""By the way tomorrow at X we will have Y tell us Decred's approach to Z"" at the end of a block about Z.

@oregonisaac raised a good point that sponsoring the whole radio can be interpreted by the public as sponsoring certain political stance/ethos. We shall be really careful about our messaging, and it is impossible to audit everything that happens on the radio. One way to address this is to pay only for the shows and not sponsor the whole radio.

What I liked:

* General concept of using radio.
* Past contribution to Decred - show with Marco. I haven't listened to it, but the sole fact of its existence is nice.
* Past contribution to cryptocurrency space.
* Libertarian audience sounds like it aligns with Decred. I'm not 100% sure as I don't know them. I hope they are not zealots - we need people who think for themselves.
* The price looks reasonable for the network of your size.
* Appreciate how you engaged in comments.

Notes:

* "":30 second"" reads a bit confusing, just ""30 second"" would do.

If this proposal is voted No, a reworked iteration can be posted later and I would suggest to focus it on non-ad content.",370da2f315e6746c4f1dc69d3a4cf635143ce09ab04b5b5ee61aec033e56f58d3f72351ff89cf17d24b3932f1fccea938b306b3d324b6122474616b3a8eb2006,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,41,46e416699d2ee3b2aecdcbf5d7b361e4f404f6e9177cd17f8b085ab1a639bfac13927fad3dc5d31f1bea92d5149972ed3e0a2dda76d8830ddaae298094589205,1544079623,3,4.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,1.0

It is a good idea, but your suggestions on implementation very likely won’t work. You want to change the format of a very successful, 16 year old, radio program, #27 in the nation with millions of monthly listens, to fit your preferences. Sure, everyone wants to do that. We have a dog vitamin supplement company that has advertised with us for years. I would bet, if asked, they would love us to talk all about dog health and stuff. The reality is that if we did such a thing, it would destroy listenership. I can't make the Decred Show, I can't even make the Crypto Show. It won't fly, or at least I don't believe that it would fly on the radio on weekdays. What you are talking about is a podcast, not a radio program. If someone makes the Decred podcast. I will happily advise my listeners to go take a listen. It is a fine idea, but this implementation of it just won't work. If you wanted to talk about total sponsorship of FTL, where Decred commits for the year at the price of 30 grand per month, we can definitely talk about that. 

I would further ad that this is the package that we sold Roger Ver to promote Bitcoin, back in 2011 or 2012, and Gavin Andresen, Roger Ver and Charlie shrem credit us with giving Bitcoin that initial boost that made it the phenom that it is today.",929e4355374160a71f31dc8bc6a8f50ffb4a5c9be013bc861871807323d2f66cb0b4b00f3e943a06fe69e1c735dd3a4bae0204ff668da77a29e4c753984c250a,f4902815caf342eaf8f1ca12826d49bedad71d36eebc7cff73616c696da9e09a,42,87adcfd25f076a93381665aaa26dceea1623ed591315fb1f67e8d1bff096541cf15e7aa7ce14d77ba43056382df8cdab14b50fda8da67e46e9867c5847dc2b04,1544109734,2,2.0,False,f8907ff7-97b2-4004-9939-99115b92bf0a,mark_ftl,

2. How many ad campaigns have they placed for crypto companies and what was the longest time frame that one of those schedules ran on a single venue?
3. What is their branding philosophy?  Do they believe in sticking with one media and creating a relationship with the audience or a haphazard media mix?
4. Will they be producing a radio ad themselves? Do they have a studio? What mics do they use? 
5. Will they be taking a 15% cut of the ad buy or are they going to pay a net rate.

- Is there a way to verify how many users are tuned-in to the show at a given time (in particular during the Decred ads)?
- How does this ad package compare to other radio shows? For example how much would it cost to advertise via national public radio?

You've listed various developer pay rates, but it looks like a significant portion of the work will be done at $25/hr. I'm a bit skeptical of quality work being performed at that pay rate.

Also, as per https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4, it is my understanding that developers (at least those working on Decredition) will need to obtain a DCC. Are you prepared for this?

as stated in last comment, I have been very busy and did attempt to engage, but time meant I was unable to keep up with all communications, although I did stay up on as much as i could.

    REUM has not demonstrated that any of its staff are capable of generating work product that is useful to the project.

OK, I have no answer for this, as we have not had a chance to show or prove anything, obviously not looking like we will get this chance, willing to build Decredex in the way we stated and prove it is possible.

    REUM does not have a track record of creating open source software.
    Creating a functional DEX is a technical project. Nothing in this proposal or on the company website convinces me that REUM has the technical capacity to complete this work.

Currently building (as project managers) for several organisations, including other currencies and some of the larger exchange businesses, can show you these projects as they are developed, established then launched, again I can see Decred has a way of doing things, was planning to place a developer and communication staff member on to the project, if I had got positive feedback, but Democracy is what is, so the check and balances have found me as not capable, I guess I need to look at myself a little in this instance. 

    This proposal and the REUM site are full of buzzword-saturated marketing speak.

I can back up every 'buzzword' with facts, but again please be specific I will rebuttal each point constructively and concede where I must concede.

    The REUM website has a section called ""Reum Brand Agency"" where they suggest using Instagram models and celebrities to promote ICOs.
    The claimed partnerships with Nasdaq and Mastercard strike me as a huge overpromise and unrealistic.

I am in talks with Nasdaq and will be hiring them to provide trade security and compliance, I am head of Europe at http://moentum.com which is SEC Approved, so ready to discuss my Mastercard https://www.prosper2.co.uk/ and Nasdaq https://business.nasdaq.com/market-tech/ contacts in detail if you wish, I have several executive connections, this is why I did not have time in the forums and social networks, I was speaking with enterprises! 

    Attempts to proactively engage regulators in the US and UK strikes me as preemptive and likely to generate negative attention for the project. The point of a DEX is to have permissionless exchange.
    The proposed budget suggests to me that REUM has very limited experience running a business.

The point of a DEX is to have permissionless exchange.

The permissions element was for DCR OTC services KYC/AML, the actual DEX would be metamask enabled, so yes fully decentralised.

How! please read the above paragraph!

The proposed timeline is unrealistic.

Surely they could have provided more technical details, if they have been working on it for 8 weeks already? There are no technical specs, not even which programming languages they are planning to use.

One paragraph in the ""How"" section of the proposal did it for me:

In the ""How"" section you are supposed to explain _how_ you are going to implement the proposal. This paragraph contains the message ""we need the Decred community to tell us what to do, because we don't have the required knowledge / skills to build this DEX ourselves""

I am a developer, I can understand technical terms. You mentioned elsewhere that you're not a developer, I understand that, get a developer that will be working on the project to explain stuff then. 

- Is there a single centralized order book server?
- Is the order book managed by a federation of servers?
- Can anyone run their own order book server?
- Or is the order book fully p2p?

> wallet to wallet transactions

Not sure what you're trying to say; let me give an example to clarify my question:

Alice has USD and wants to buy DCR from Bob with her USD. Now, how does Alice pay her USD to Bob? Directly, or is there an intermediary? What prevents Bob from keeping both the USD and DCR? Or, if Bob sends the DCR first, what prevents Alice from getting the DCR and never sending the USD?

1. Not nearly every cryptocurrency has its own exchange.

But there is little details on the: financial objectives, business strategy, organizational structure, relations with and obligations to DCR, expectations and goals, etc or even what branch is it expected to live one. 

Would consider any real meat on this, if the investment asked would have good returns balancing out the risks, e.g. how much of your business would DCR own and how can that be solved legally (if it even can be done)? How quickly would you pay back the investment from DCR treasury and in what terms would this generate revenue towards DCR treasury? 

Certainly don’t see it becoming the next Binance or Coinbase. These ships have sailed. Neither is it a decentralised exchange or competing with those in production. What bothers me the most is the real term “decentralised exchange” not being respected here. As if it’s tied to fiat, credit card services etc then by no means can you call it a decentralized exchange. 

If the likely outcome is another low-tier exchange, would be a waste of project funds imo. I see no point in competing with rest of them and can expect huge risks considering how much trust and security issues these various smaller exchanges have in their track record. E.g. this being super close under the Decred umbrella – gets hacked or business goes bad = very bad rep for DCR. Personally I think there are enough of these fishy exchanges that do no favours to the whole cryptospace.

- 4 devs at 25$/h with this scope and schedule seems deeply questionable regarding the weight of responsibility. If they are doing the work on the side, you should provide proof of trackrecord and competence. Who are they, CV's? Quality blockchain devs are scarce, so otherwise without proof it may be whoever, juniors or outsourced indian devs just chopping something together.
- Combined 245k on marketing/pr before having an actual product is way out of balance (almost 45% of dev budget), and in conflict with DCR’s ethos on actually building the products first.
- Reference from reum.io/brand-agency – is a kind of marketing approach I personally find repulsive and completely unfitting for anything serious in the financial sector altogether. Keeping in mind DCR’s more conservative approach on marketing and general attitude towards the ICO boom, i’d imagine you should be well aware how conflicting this is?
- On the same time there is no budget allocated for design and UX. Big red flag, considering this is a far more important factor than marketing/pr. Only need good design and good communications at this stage.

He was enthusiastic, had a lot of buzzword-y things to say, and was told about the process to become a contractor for the project.  In the months since then, he and other REUM staff have made zero effort to become contractors.  As such, we have no experience with their work product, and it seems clear they are not interested in engaging with the existing contractor community.

That said, I see a number of things that are alarming with this proposal.  To avoid being sucked into making an epic and detailed reply to this proposal, I will post my criticisms as a set of succinct bullet points:

* REUM and its staff have made no real effort to engage the existing project contractors or the wider community prior to this proposal.
* REUM has not demonstrated that any of its staff are capable of generating work product that is useful to the project.
* REUM does not have a track record of creating open source software.
* Creating a functional DEX is a technical project.  Nothing in this proposal or on the company website convinces me that REUM has the technical capacity to complete this work.
* This proposal and the REUM site are full of buzzword-saturated marketing speak.
* The REUM website has a section called ""Reum Brand Agency"" where they suggest using Instagram models and celebrities to promote ICOs.
* The claimed partnerships with Nasdaq and Mastercard strike me as a huge overpromise and unrealistic.
* Attempts to proactively engage regulators in the US and UK strikes me as preemptive and likely to generate negative attention for the project.  The point of a DEX is to have permissionless exchange.
* The proposed budget suggests to me that REUM has very limited experience running a business.
* The proposed timeline is unrealistic.
* Creating a proposal based on an idea and simply pointing at some dev shops when it comes to the implementation runs contrary to the spirit of the project.  The purpose of our proposal system is not to fund ""shower thoughts"".",fb130b2813b292b22d67569f616772e9d83d2effda2dacb6aef39543225ecb797c8e807dba28d775d0e223093880520c50049aaa28f6bdf22e40a2849113e806,e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360,4,77715914b9df68069f1dd861930d3f45d2bf5eb61be16b92a35d7cacea671c54caa42acaebe7a3b7eb02d33e5386a1ce77600fee8a2511a1258da2d3def6b208,1543422922,18,18.0,False,fe62dd6a-2cc6-4d41-abd0-522528d33ae7,jy-p,

We would offer the Decred organisation 100% of all the revenue, thus proving ourselves over a long term period, we are a small group so it would be difficult to communicate consistently with the community while building the DEX, we left out GUI element from the budget request, as we can provide this element in house.

business strategy:

it is just a part of our plans to grow into an exchange service provider, which will bring us enterprise level clients, to build their exchanges revenue and business is paid up-front for exchange delivery, then the buyer keeps all exchange trade profits and arbitrage fees revenue.
 
organizational structure:

REUM Ltd, based in the UK, as a project management team alongside some external developers.

relations with and obligations to DCR, 

To introduce a REUM tech and communication staff members to engage Decred and to join as a contractor and to walk through all of the rules of engagement with Decred, we are conceding on this proposal, but we will come back positively and prove our worth to Decred.

If they are doing the work on the side, you should provide proof of trackrecord and competence. Who are they, CV's? Quality blockchain devs are scarce, so otherwise without proof it may be whoever, juniors or outsourced indian devs just chopping something together.
    Combined 245k on marketing/pr before having an actual product is way out of balance (almost 45% of dev budget), and in conflict with DCR’s ethos on actually building the products first.
    Reference from reum.io/brand-agency – is a kind of marketing approach I personally find repulsive and completely unfitting for anything serious in the financial sector altogether. Keeping in mind DCR’s more conservative approach on marketing and general attitude towards the ICO boom, i’d imagine you should be well aware how conflicting this is?
    On the same time there is no budget allocated for design and UX. Big red flag, considering this is a far more important factor than marketing/pr. Only need good design and good communications at this stage.

I am in full support of it, the only question I have is about the number of contractors required to grant or take a DCC. Would it work if we set a more dynamic number, perhaps via percentage of contractors, of a specific subdomain? My worry is only that revoking someone's DCC usually creates controversy so we must be certain that it will be seen as a legitimate action.

This is exactly my worry, that it would be 3 people who are of the same entity. Does ""ideal"" mean it will be just hoped for, as opposed to enforced? Enforcing this would be difficult. 

So my question is, would you be open to the idea of experimenting with a different number or perhaps a percentage, as opposed to a fixed number 3? And what was the rationale behind arriving at that number?

1. This system strikes me as inherently vulnerable to politics & corruption. I don't think we can engineer that fact away; we're dealing with something that we can't have the stakeholders directly vote on, due to the domain knowledge required. As a result, this particular process is quite similar to representative democracy (and we all know how that tends to work). Just something to keep in mind, and ensure proper checks and balances to compensate.

2. How much should soft skills factor into issuing DCCs? For example, a developer writes good code, but:
   - Has very poor written English skills, making communication with other developers very difficult. Or:
   - Is extremely abrasive to co-workers; uses explicit language to refer to other developers and/or their work when things aren't done his way.
  
  On one hand, soft skills are important; on the other hand, this could be taken too far. Different people have different views on what is acceptable behavior, and I wouldn't like to see a conflict similar to a US Senate appointment battle over a DCC.
3. > These votes would be made by individual DCC holders, not the corporate entities they work for.
  
  That's a pretty big assumption. If we're designing a system that's supposed to be robust in adversarial circumstances, we should assume that corporate entities will attempt to force their employees to vote a specific way. Either we need a system that can work in such a case, or we need strict rules and clearly defined consequences for corporate entities engaging in such behavior (e.g. revoking the corporation's ability to bill for X amount of time). I would prefer the latter option.
4. All-contractor votes being weighted by hours billed seems reasonable, but I'm wondering if such a system could be susceptible to a group of contractors that have performed the majority of work in recent history using this power to either operate a cartel ensuring only they are allowed to work on Decred, or enforcing the status quo and not allowing new developers using newer technologies to work on Decred, resulting in technological stagnation.
  
  This could possibly be done if the DCC holders cartel tells the stakeholders that the developers being excluded from getting DCCs are writing genuinely bad code. If most of the stakeholders are non-technical, they will likely assume the existing DCC holders are telling the truth, and allow the cartel to go on right under their noses.

  Perhaps I'm just being paranoid here, and I do admit this scenario is probably pretty unlikely, but it's still worth considering all possible cases IMO.",2ecdad63d57a2370e80e0841eb33222d45e40a5f26868e5d7d724945b5dd211b8b0c9fc2a43399340c7f04603ab91393afe618aa2c2173dd86270158716de000,1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106,12,a1ab1c2c71b39a6c0ec28572347d7a25d82777e2664d6332c929b79905c22591e8fb76be8854b9171ccd9418e140e29e4ef48f794b8dde7506a5988c1166850e,1540044035,13,13.0,False,8b7137f1-bb9e-46a3-bb20-f9750863aeec,ryanzim,

1. As currently written, this system seems to be highly vulnerable to political preferences in getting more work for their own contracting company, conflict of interests or personal grudges.

For example: 2 Development Contracting companies. Company A has 5 developers and Company B has 1 developer. Company A can agree to revoke companies B DCC to get their work.

**From proposal:**

> It is ideal for these 3 contractors who vouch for an issuance or revocation to not be from the same corporate entity, whenever possible, and, more generically, to be independent of one another. Auditing these DCC issuance and revocation proposals for conflicts-of-interest will be an ongoing task.

In my opinion, the contractor's company should have 1 vote. For example Company A with 5 members has 1 vote, Contractor Company with 1 member has 1 vote. 

If left as is, some contracting companies will have a monopoly over the entire project or a branch. I don't think it's healthy for the future of the project.

2. Subdomain voting for granting or revoking DCC.
Having 3 contractors in a subdomain vouch for the issuance or revocation of a DCC forces those contractors to have skin-in-the-game when it comes to staffing decisions.

For example, some contractors work and contribute to multiple subdomains: design, social media/marketing, and events. Taking into consideration votes from only 1 subdomain would be not sufficient.

3. Sub-Contractors
I totally agree on the need of clearing sub-contractors that work for DCC contractors.

4. Stakeholders
Ultimately, some decisions will go to stakeholders for a final approval as we may not be able to resolve by internal voting.

Overall, this is a step in the right direction an I'm looking forward to more comments and ideas.

1. Every system is vulnerable to politics and corruption.  This proposal is an attempt to make staffing for the project not require my or any other project oracles' involvement.

2. The extent to which soft skills factor into this varies across subdomains.  Historically, we really don't care much about language skills so long as people can adapt to feedback and work constructively within their subdomain.

3. If a corporate contractor is found to be engaging in contractor vote manipulation, the punishment can be determined by an all-contractor vote.  I obviously can't speak for other corporate contractors besides Company 0, but I am really keen to stay out of these kinds of conflicts and let the individuals duke it out.

4. Regarding cartel behavior, which has been shown to be emergent in some systems, or other collusive behavior, this is exactly why I proposed the ability to escalate this to a proposal for stakeholders to vote on.  The scenario you describe is roughly what has happened with Bitcoin, but I have also seen some legitimately bad code that merits scrutiny.  If the stakeholders can be fooled into buying into arguments that boil down to an appeal-to-authority, we have more serious problems than the DCC model.",7d048c7a1370a542813b6b68ca82f489e7ce7c226973167e0c97a8189f9a2cb603264b48cabdc372f4956e5b6c969961505b4833e6411e948a130ba7b5199408,e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360,21,961111bf90090fcef40b552242e2b6fdfe475582bcc68bf114d7be6742e4994fda81b6b23480ea4ce0dc46324a91df3e6edc0be5a205b65552c3592f86257007,1540069072,8,8.0,False,fe62dd6a-2cc6-4d41-abd0-522528d33ae7,jy-p,

In several cases, outright termination was the only real option for contractors who were overbilling and under-delivering.

1. Per my response to ryanzim, every system can be gamed.  There is an escalation process that can address punitive or self-interested actions.  The current system where I mediate these conflicts, or where they are mediated by some other person or group, are also vulnerable to gaming.  Even in the design subdomain where you do some of your work, there are several groups performing work, not just one entity.  This diversity applies to most subdomains, AFAICR.  Corporate contractors only having a single vote creates a substantial incentive against being a corporate contractor, whereas every individual DCC holder being able to vote reflects the skin-in-the-game more accurately.

2. Regarding working in multiple subdomains, I think that it could make sense to allow for a DCC to apply to one or more subdomains, and partial revocations to occur.  It would also make sense for a multi-subdomain contractor to be allowed to vouch in their corresponding subdomains, but their all-contractor vote would be handled the same way as everyone else's.

Given all else that has been discussed I'm guessing no, but this should be made explicit: the process of obtaining a DCC is different than joining one of the existing core development teams (from which you can bill and whose budget will be discussed in a different proposal) and/or getting approval for participation in a particular proposal which would allow the originating entity (either an independent contractor or a corporate contractor) to actually bill for that particular proposal.

My concern is making explicit the dynamics for development teams/companies, the goals of the DCC system in particular and, more broadly, the high level goals of Politeia and the DAE.

I should contextualize that I'm from a country with somewhat strong worker protection laws, in which it's expensive to hire, maintain and terminate worker contracts, any given company can be easily sued for (improper, even if non intentional) worker compensation and (usually) loses those suits. And in full disclosure, I'm also trying to bring in some new developers following the proposed format for the DCCs.

Therefore I'll use a hypothetical example to tease out some of these concerns: Development shop Alpha (that currently does not have DCC holding employees) wants to propose a given software. Let's assume the idea itself is sound, well accepted and the team is generally regarded as competent at a first glance.

So now, the team from Alpha will have to get DCCs in order for the proposal to be put up for voting. Alpha itself (assuming it's a standard consulting business) will bear the cost for the work performed by their employees while acquiring the DCC. These developers will then be eligible for participation in Alpha's proposal.

Now, will Alpha's devs be able to directly bill for work performed (outside the context of Alpha's proposal)? Or will there be a separate process from which they'll have to join one of the existing core teams (possibly incidentally terminating their employment contract with Alpha)?

I assume this sort of situation will only be answerable in time, as we get more experience with Politeia and evolve the DAE. 

But we should make it explicit if the system is designed to be contractor-centric (a dev getting a DCC while working for a corporate contractor is only granted it as it relates to that corporation's proposals) or DCC-holder-centric (once you get a DCC, it's personally yours whether you remain in the contractor that ""sponsored"" you or not - and corporate contractors should have that in mind when hiring, training and maintaining employees).",c1eb060d262206df4358f3febcd325d66f5739bc18752477684b2230478d806baf7f1b04af5d8f22680355e9ca6252013c824d741c804614cb2fda1fb3b04502,6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686,33,848c7e9bd0a381f0662e57545d858d6a4ce0fe197c07f715d77226dc7cc3de9dbc135d87c4cc6dd00b79461e63b6619ab647660ddaa676c78c19fae134790a06,1540211214,7,8.0,False,a287e4dc-9ba1-4eee-ab1f-9dcbf90c2f82,matheusd,1.0

3. I was just thinking it might be good to include a statement in the proposal condemning corporate vote manipulation and recommending a penalty be enforced.

  I realize we can't make this code-enforced, but I was thinking along the lines of how the Decred Constitution states the 21 million supply limit. There's nothing that actually prevents an on-chain vote from modifying that limit, but most stakeholders would be opposed to it since it runs contrary to the Constitution.

I like this proposal. The existing process (show up, do, apply), is great. It's how employment should work, IMO. However, it requires a large leap of faith on the part of potential contractors. People have to invest a significant amount of time and energy up front, with no guarantee of being paid. From Decred's perspective, this is totally reasonable. Prospective contractors require a significant investment from Decred, in the form of time and energy spent onboarding, reviewing work, training, etc., with no guarantee of getting valuable work in return. The current materials around becoming a contractor (docs, blogs, etc.) express all this very well, along with the ethos of the project. In the end, it worked out for me. I'm psyched to be able to commit more to the project. However, I can see how this process could exclude many talented people who either can't handle the higher levels of uncertainty, or who have fewer financial resources than I do. 

If there was a system like the one proposed, and it actually works as intended, I think my journey would have been less stressful, and probably more productive. I also like the idea of having more visibility into the hiring/firing process moving forward. Indeed, it's my first month. I could still not work out and not have my contract renewed (no hard feelings). But I would want to at least know why it didn't work out!

Related question: will existing contractors be automatically given a DCC? Or will there be some process for determining which existing contractors get DCCs?

My only concern is that this system becomes corrupted in ways other commenters have worried about. If this turned into office politics as usual, I'm out. However, I generally trust the project leads' deep understanding (theoretical and experiential) of governance, system design, and automation. And I think the Decred's general strategy of incremental rollout is wise and tested. E.g. I'm glad a human is still distributing funds from Pi for now. 

If this works, it could unleash huge productivity gains and make Decred an even more exciting experiment. I want to work in a DAE.",3a20d101a08abad2e8382ce14b583b63879f6bf6879d01bb54181f579c147fad80564290907284112bc6499a0f5a54653a440c7614995fd5412f5facbc592e07,5122d5762113077bd2968b5b99f826ce54eaa52e72d0c93620351225dabd08be,37,05eaafd117416f563336c48a604b292d1ce31a2933f308ae1b13f1575a2e7e59076d321d4237a518b2c8da19f0326b1f9ccdd33757b391dff73c390029fe2107,1540934971,3,4.0,False,107efb48-3ab1-4830-8b69-35842ca010de,s_ben,1.0

I also like the thinking around an all contractor override weighted by hours worked as a way of escalating a dispute without resorting to a ticket vote.

The relationship between the contractor community and the stakeholder community is an important one. A process like this will give the contractor community more independence, and I think that is the right way to go.

It will mean we have to get more formal about identifying domains and who is active in which one. That seems like a useful thing to track publicly anyway.

1\. Treasury control is kind of ""last line of defense"". Stakeholders can't directly vote on contractors but they can defund anything they don't like. This is usually not the case for delegated democracies, where the voters cannot defund bad projects.

Another idea is that the DCC could be revoked by a stakeholder vote without waiting for proper escalation (3 contractor vote -> all contractor vote -> stakeholder vote), that could be blocked by a cartel. Is this possible in the DCC process, @jy-p?

2\. Soft skills boil down to whether an individual can work with existing contractors without damaging his or others' productivity. If his English is poor, but others understand him, are not too irritated and like his deliverables, that will work. If he uses explicit language or jokes on diversity, but nobody is offended and no productivity is lost, that will work. Even if a person is a total devil he can look for a semi-isolated corporate entity, work via a ""softening proxy assistant"", or start his own company where he is nice to stakeholders but yells at his subordinates.

3\. If a corporate entitiy tries to force its employees to vote a certain way, the employee as an individual will have to decide for himself. If he succumbs to employer order that goes against the benefit of stakeholders, he risks losing reputation and his DCC. The fact that DCC is granted to individuals as opposed to blurry companies is helpful here.

4\. Stakeholders are incentivized by their skin in the game to not be fooled by the developers, and any contractors in general. This is a fundamental human problem of delegation. When you're not an expert in domain X and you hire someone to do X for you, he can fool you. But if you have something to lose, you'll do your best effort to choose the right person for the job.",fd14e9bbe041338bc582297db5d3375b688cd39faa7faa5349e86e302daf5260fe560cd41e250e8a35ca67a45c7993a0d18d7a315566532f94456d7e0ef61804,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,42,f75b0ec1e3cda2585c2f762402501b9960f24fc7b4aaf9d2438e426eecded07fa4916f24d2a0405e92d439866aff6acfd8f5bd5f0eda0b39b9b58e81cd27fc02,1542747191,0,,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

Let's take for example someone who has built a small tool or utility software that doesn't fit in current repos around Decred. This person may be a talented dev and the community may benefit of his work, but he may not necessarily have the time or desire to get a DCC by contributing in other parts of the project before submitting his work.

Could maybe these smaller contributions be an alternate path to obtain the DCC? Or maybe we could have a special repo for smaller and new initiatives where people can submit their already completed work without having the DCC?

Regarding voting fatigue, someone could manage payments in this ""special"" repo each month. Itself becoming the proposal for the sum of the contributions seen as valuable. But we would be back to having a gatekeeper or elected official for this task unless we manage to decentralize the process or have some other way to validate what is considered valuable or not by the community...

Also, this raise the question of what would happen if someone submit a small proposal for already completed work, for which the community is highly in favor, but the developer behind it has no DCC, and maybe no experience to contribute in existing repos?

My first thoughts on such listing fee propositions have to do with understanding if the exchange actually has justification for the fee.

A regular exchange asking a listing fee just to list an asset, when fees from that assets trading bring profit to the exchange, is a huge red flag for me.  They should list the coin anyway since the alternative is to get no profit at all (this is what most respectable exchanges seem to do).

What I see here is an exchange that has already listed the asset and is offering a lowered fee among other things.  Now, it is a valid question to ask if the initial fees were already too high, or if the lowered fees are lowered enough.",39283014355dc59fededa67229b1a6445c453641c1cd2b8314cc02b6232a54831612caafe721464f3aa63c09c2789e36332e885e7990f0af22f7c4e539d40505,22b54aa3030d05ebb4ab31c5c719b8fec9d979928ce517222fe80195e0d3596d,10,4eb3403593af1ecfa18dffed082aeb1ce72a2eea7e1da637dbdb7c1d6761718e6305bcece39a4c2e38ea00bb3bd20659a1c7b0ac41094e9055b57cb344996b00,1541036762,1,1.0,False,7f3a60e9-a8d1-4e43-a68a-94bb2409d75c,chappjc,

DCR is already available for on Easyrabbit it seems, and the relatively small price for the ""upgrade"" comes with some real benefits to Decred, which do come at a cost to this exchange.

Specifically, (1) widget integration and (2) lower fees for users, come at a cost to the exchange and have obvious benefits to users of DCR.  Arguably, this is true for social media promotion where there's only so much room for tweets about the coins they support.

On the other hand, paying to put the DCR logo in their ""featured section"" is arguably of less value and feels a bit against our values.  Is that different from social media promotion?  Maybe not much, but the reach of social media is important for informing/reminding those already interested in DCR that there is another service they can use.  But featured placement on their homepage does not seem necessary if you come to the site already knowing what you want to do (hopefully buy DCR).

What can go wrong with this proposal? ""Constant promotion"" sounds a bit like spam everyone all the time.  Also, the mere acceptance of this proposal could reflect poorly, if it weren't for the redeeming fact that 30 DCR is a modest sum that is actually appropriate for the added services.

While I am hoping for few marketing proposals in general and many productive proposals like development and research, we should not completely dismiss marketing. This is not just about advertising, this proposal seems to focus a lot on communication, events and public speaking, which is a good idea in my opinion. 

Caution must be taken though not to make decred appear like a corporate for profit entity that spends a lot on marketing and tries to attract investors.  
That would not resonate well within the cryptocurrency community, but from the proposal it looks like the provider is well aware of the core values of decred. 

The current branding (logo, stakey, graphics are very very good, clean and nicely designed and I would not change the branding at all. 

If we have one very professional provider who is able to add significant value to decred, then I would support having one provider with a clear plan and structure as opposed to countless scattered marketing proposals.

I was one DCR team members listening in on the presentation call. My impression with Wachsmans brief presentation was positive, as they focused on quite real practicalities and describing a methodical way of doing things (on PR and Events fronts) rather than attempting to sell the project based on past clients rep. or vague promises. 

As a designer, i'm very considerate about the optics and how different actions effect the reputation of the project. I'm largely in favour of the proposal, as it's mostly sound and proportionate in the ways it relates to these matters. 

Afaik there is not a conflict of interest with their other crypto clients, as there's different employees assigned to these projects, nevertheless this needs to be heavily covered in the legal contracts. 

In response to some comments preferring only the current ""grass-roots"" approach and fears around giving off so called ""corporate vibe"" – these cases should not be looked at in a black and white manner. Decred needs a solid PR & events output and professional presence just as much as it needs the friendly enthusiasts and community hotheads. One does not have to conflict the other. I would imagine worse future outcomes if DCR happens to lack on the professional front – as then it simply may not be taken seriously and get the foot through the door when needed. One must not forget, this is a financial product after all. 

To give an illustrated example, quoting one of my past critiques around overusing and turning the spaceman jacket into a bad gimmick if presented wrong context: 
“I am an investor or a person working at relevant business/institution visiting a conference with aim to connect with xyz crypto projects – see a number of professional and respectable looking talkers. Last talk is Decred. I don’t know what Decred is yet. See someone looking like a clown come to the stage. Red flag hits, leave before it starts as the first impression is ruined and i’ve got better things to do.” First impression one won’t get to re-do. 

There are certain marketing and PR approaches that are fundamentally incompatible with DCR imo, for example: deeply sales oriented and high-pressure sales tactics; ""fishsalesmen type"" hype/spam campaigns relying on overpromising, dumbing down; dishonest, misleading or very clickbaity communications for content or campaign advertising, all kind of referral/multi-level marketing schemes. I don't think any of these are present here.

**Media Training + Speaker positioning** 

This service should certainly be focused on. Correct me if i'm wrong, but in the long term DCR will need many topnotch spokespersons rather than relying primarily on Jake and Marco, as neither wish to build images of a central figures. Ideally this service can be leveraged to help train existing community members up, to be better enquipped for the role. Meaning DCR will in the long run have many adept spokespersons. Giving presentations and interviews is simply another skill that can always be improved through work and training. I find it negligible if situation occurs where people who are untrained or with little to no experience end up giving presentations, interviews etc about the project.

**Key Messaging and Brand Narrative Development + Content Creation**

This is the only item I have some concerns about. There are three people listed in the team with mostly directional roles, however none with a dedicated focus on creative copywriting or a creative strategy work. (These are marked as secondary roles.)

Working out key messaging + a communications strategy and documenting it in a reasonable way has been an item that I've discussed with 2 or 3 no longer present marketing contributors, of who none successfully delivered any useful results. So this should not be taken lightly. 

Although DCR has a number of excellent in-house writers, I would say we've always been missing the creative copywriting types. The issue here is that documentation writing, research writings, journalism writings and creative copywriting are all very different animals. A lot of the comms. output so far has been written by a group. Comparing it objectively to brands who have it created by dedicated professionals – these will never be on the same level.

When it comes to creative copywriting, communication strategy creation and such – to get something actually useful worked out in DCR's context, this task absolutely needs at least one specialized senior level copywriter (or creative director, strategist whatever the title w/ similar background) with a strong, demonstrable track-record (e.g. case studies). Reason being that the scope itself is already way too big for a non-dedicated or directional roles to cover: building an deep understanding, creating objectives and devising strategies to accomplish them, concepting work, creative problem solving, imaginativness and eye for detail, going in-depth with calibrating the voice and articulations, having an understanding of various aspects of branding, awarness and ability to tell difference between short lived trends and timeless techniques, strong judgement and projection skills on outcomes, ability to sync with the design direction, etc… You get my point.

Also in case there's plan of using shadow-writers to assist the key personnel – this has been tried and did not work well. I'm in favour of the actual people doing the work being behind the table and accountable.

This essentially will work as a tool and a standard for everyone who wants to communicate about Decred – meaning that tangible deliverables and well accessible documentation of the work are of importance here. For one potential benchmark, I would suggest to take a look at the project https://brand.estonia.ee/story/core-messages/ where quite reasonable communication guidelines were developed for a large (and obviously even harder to define) entity – this being a country, but it's end use case is similar to DCR as it's meant for very different businesses and individuals.

Obviously one of the most difficult parts of the project will be getting the ultimate agreement on what goes. I'm well aware that having too many cooks in the kitchen will mess up the work and I obviously don't recommend this. Preferably the concept development process could include a small number of expert contributors covering the key disciplines of the projects. Only once a rough consensus on a solution is agreed, this can be brought out for larger reviewing. Also type of involvement, tasks and responsibilities for each participant should be well defined from the start to. 

To wrap things up, my questions are: 
- Can you elaborate on this item, your process and the deliverables output for this work? 
- Do you plan on involving more talent to cover this front? 

Thanks.",ed11f934b4e1583f599e0293cc52b9c3a69035c55c2c8a58ef6c2b1c35d6c98d1b4b47a99a4d90c7c1a8fb5090d6aa90210bf8fb4e588db3597b72a989f95508,23fe3a8aae4b6234a2bc15b2dbe9973e13287ed0849fbd5e3fd743709c737b73,18,25479acadcb07901f0e2bf6e31e3dad347a655c357037fae9e84c102431798f24d0d56a49b37b3e075fafccec228f74b3ab83fe402edec81cb2da98fd0a9e704,1540223542,3,3.0,False,ba96e181-abff-4c1a-b2be-9bb916ea4083,linnutee,

Agree wholeheartedly here. The fact that Decred is a horse of a different wheelbase isn’t just a major draw for us — it’s a notion that we anticipate will be exceptionally (and justifiably) well-received by the media as well. This is especially true for the more “mainstream” reporters, many of whom will honestly just hang up the phone if they hear “ICO” or “Token Sale.” 

> We don't do hype, we build. We under-promise, over-deliver.

Very, very good call here. This would absolutely be our recommendation as well. 

Wachsman’s goal is never to merely promote hype around a project, it is to demonstrate to the wider blockchain, cryptocurrency, and mainstream communities the inherent value propositions of our clients in a non-hyperbolic way. Wachsman endeavors to act as a megaphone through which Decred’s message can be heard by a greater audience, bringing those with whom this message resonates with into the community. 

>  In interests of decentralization, we don't want centralization around Jake.
 
While we completely understand the importance of maintaining decentralization, from a media (and events) standpoint we feel that it is exceptionally important for there to be at least one — but likely more depending on the communications vertical — advocate/ambassador that is available and media trained to communicate Decred’s story to the world and distinguish Decred from competitors (it is my understanding that we will be doing media training for 6+ individuals, but are more than happy to offer it to more people, as needed). 

This is exceptionally important when it comes to communication verticals like thought leadership/ expert commentary. Wachsman has mainstream reporters reaching out to us daily for quick commentary, and the ability to have an established representative from Decred readily available to turn around initial thoughts on breaking news is hugely beneficial for securing coverage. We anticipate that during our engagement we will work closely with the Decred community as a whole, but in the interest of keeping Decred on people’s radar outside of major announcements, suggest a strong media presence for select team members at least in the immediate future.",4418dfa696e3b15a14ac1d9a2a5833fdf27f3111ee65e09adaa2da25a1adccac25b588e25635eb1193337a9520b6a1bf0443973784d23b8b7996fc9ae7b96408,2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443,20,a9aa2336fadcca1cc62a61f0a0d151d3ff04a3f68e07cc72827a5b73bfed2ac866ed7ad0d9c8927b0ec70781b52da0f784d476fc4f9464679feb8ecc00a9b90a,1540232829,2,2.0,False,cb9e6dde-b151-4a34-9317-e3136f0c8eee,tomcurranlevett,

Wachsman will never pay for media placements for our clients, nor will we deploy advertising budgets. We strongly believe that the best way to generate brand awareness and exposure is through organic media exposure based primarily on the core value propositions of our clients, and the communication of these value propositions to the relevant members of the media in a strategic and measured manner. 

Wachsman are true admirers of the community Decred has built as well as the values on which it was built upon, and we would never tarnish these values by offering Decred a “brand in a box” proposal. What we endeavor to do is to magnify the achievements already made by the Decred community, and the achievements which Decred will undoubtedly make in the future by communiticating them to the world in the correct manner, a manner which is in line with these founding values and the long term goals and ambitions of Decred.

> With the work that goes on to make Decred what it is, independent media outlets will continue to keep up with the project and our exposure will grow along side the project.

This is certainly true to an extent, and congratulations are definitely in order given the project’s success to date. It is our firm belief, however, that given the amazing growth of the project so far - and all the significant milestones to come - Decred deserves a robust expansion of media coverage. What Decred is doing is truly exceptional and you have all worked hard to get here — ** everyone ** should know about it!

Furthermore, it is worth stressing the value of a strategic approach to media, as opposed to one that is merely reactive and ad hoc. There is immense value in controlling your narrative and having news come from you — not just being about you and out of your control. Wachsman has spent years developing unmatched relationships with media (both in trade and mainstream) and as such is uniquely suited to navigate the media landscape, knowing when and which reporters to offer select pitches and announcements to — ultimately striving to have more control over when and what things are said about Decred and how the project is positioned by the media.",e70bd21e5994c60cb67cd472796209d2d78a8f636038e60656ce4388b41c0b706527845e1d84d6670efd1610fa91d50a09b3e32bc5bf9fe5bd3f77ca25e5f302,2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443,21,af4ea34f93286db0b83c2cb376535a52a51f24955fbc6e2bab68b13d14a112041e77ce00d51fcfcda677911a609d61002ec7f7c9c577d3978b345ab019ba050c,1540233005,3,3.0,False,cb9e6dde-b151-4a34-9317-e3136f0c8eee,tomcurranlevett,

The Decred devs and team members are doing an enormous job at the moment with all the work being done; balancing their precious time between coding, testing, speaking about Decred, writing material, answering questions, attending events and being active on various platforms.

Hear me out on this one. I've attended the DASH conference and saw how Wachsman PR worked for them. DASH paid not only for PR but for a full rebrand into a more commercial product. As a result, the core team decided to be more hands off and assumed that PR is ""covered"". Dash core stopped answering questions about DASH development and started becoming more distant and corporate. All communication with the core team was ""filtered"" via and it felt very distant.

My worry is that a firm with experience dealing with other cryptocurrencies in the space will find that Decred is a horse of a different wheelbase. We don't do hype, we build. We under-promise, over-deliver. 

> As part of the company’s narrative, Wachsman will position Jake Yocom-Piatt as the primary spokesperson and media point of contact.

I'd like to know Jake's thoughts on this. In interests of decentralization, we don't want centralization around Jake. I greatly trust and respect him, and I expect he will have significant influence in the project for the foreseeable future, but we're not here to make a cult of personality around him.

Overall, this looks like a great pitch for promoting a company, but Decred is not a company. It's a decentralized cryptocurrency.

Also, from the diverse list of clients, it seems to indicate that Wachsman will promote nearly any project that has funding available. I totally understand why a marketing company would do that from a revenue perspective. However, I wonder if it wouldn't be more effective to have marketing people who actually are sold on DCR themselves; they HODL DCR, they stake DCR, they're perhaps even active here on Politeia. In other words, take DCR community members who have marketing experience, and pay them to market DCR more effectively.

If we would go ahead with Wachsman, I would prefer a shorter trial period before committing to six months. Or is the current proposal cancelable at any time?

One of the things I’ve noticed when companies meet with us is they say, “You know, our last PR firm had good ideas but it just translated to more work for us. And we don’t have time to do all that.” We pride ourselves in making sure Ditto does all the heavy lifting. Doesn’t mean we won’t need some of your valuable time. But it’s also why we are considered the “anti PR Agency.” We do things the right way, which isn’t how other PR firms do it.

A good PR plan actually takes time OFF your schedule. If we create a smart plan, prioritize, etc., Ditto can then execute without having to bother you too much. I’d argue a good PR plan maximizes the time you have – not add on more time. And it’s why we don’t charge by the hour, like most PR firms. We’d much rather get BIG results in less time than the opposite of that.

Backing up a little more, we work with developers ranging from coding bootcamps to founders to blockchain companies.

We have seen time and time again with the company’s coming to us from other firms that it’s the only way you can service blockchain projects. Decred’s representatives, community, and developers are working tirelessly to do all the work you mentioned and more. None of this succeeds if we have to give you more work because we don’t have a big enough or experienced enough or committed enough team in place to service Decred. 
Take our events support for instance — the main reason that we began offering it to clients is because we saw many dedicating a ton of time to navigating the 700 plus crypto events (not to mention hundreds of events we can support you with in other verticals, like mainstream finance or tech) that come into their inboxes a year. With Wachsman, Decred’s representatives and community essentially won’t have to worry about anything related to events coordination other than booking flights and hotels. Speaker pitches, negotiating pricing with organizers, booth set up, even SWAG coordination — we’re taking it off your plate.
The very first thing that Wachsman would do when Decred comes on is have a full kickoff call with the community-chosen representatives of the project (on a conference call that you’re all more than welcome to listen in on). This kickoff call (frankly it’s a brain dump) lets our team get extremely well versed in the project, its timeline, its needs, hopes for positioning in the media, and more. We learn your project inside and out so that we can bring it to reporters and events organizers without needing to go back and forth to your team, slowing down the process and making more work for you. 
Our efforts will always look to highlight the amazing work of your team — not burden it.",9defff8d89de63bbd3f763ce84078c2767e71ce6de5722a4049459c41138f798fde61bd85968813aa0d95e4621578fcf25a0d9db56254f11e03f470c62f40908,2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443,42,87558cd513415d4fcaa456870eb5ab1874b481ad737f47fc98a903443d98bc90cb63355f2f25257cfb6b5f04b2903a2162b4a52509ed9af37c4c21cd5537db09,1540393293,2,2.0,False,cb9e6dde-b151-4a34-9317-e3136f0c8eee,tomcurranlevett,

- Lisk

- IOHK

- aelf
- Kochava
- CoinDesk
- Sharespost
- Steemit

The litmus test for a good PR firm is their ability to keep their client's so happy during the course of their contract that they sign to an extension past the initial contract period.

We wanted to take this chance to further highlight Wachsman’s results as a key differentiator between us and any other firm in this industry. To that end, and recognizing that the Wachsman Client Coverage Snapshot is a bit out of date (10.10.18 — 10.14.18), below is a selection of Wachsman client coverage from the last three days (10.22.18 - 10.25.18) — includes everything from interviews to bylines to features to expert commentary. Happy to detail this more (and always happy to highlight other examples of the work we do).

Particularly impressed by Wachsman's:

- Track record and Blockchain experience

- Team credential and depth

- Global footprint (Asia presence is key)

While it was previously stated that Wachsman does not operate off  KPI's I still think there could be some upfront exposure targets to give us all a better sense of what our investment will translate to in terms of output.

How do you guys at Wachsman measure success internally?  

Should Decred come up with our own internal perspective on what success means or contract out a project to independently measure the effectiveness of either of the PR agencies if they are selected?",2dd0ee38b54362ee47f5830687e1f2105e5ad4c0c1c7f49dfbec314c3ead301399e2e5ca66d0fa34de2da4421b1975e0dfeb3dddfdab49a5fbec30a3afb16300,6b19278a1e5a3a21e44da5377c6ded5a91862126d18c8e08a2370affe715537d,51,c7fd1647bc6322437583d5dd059ecd27c87495743baeb860efd166c216706b402af646c3a9bfe5ec6fc165d849865404335a730ccca310fb5b4002cc27ee6804,1540655605,4,4.0,False,a938351b-56ae-420c-b4d6-04c4d3f89966,nottrunner,

If you're not happy, we aren't happy - that's how we measure it. 

While you're right in that I cannot list specific KPI's (i.e ""we'll get Decred in Forbes this week""), I can point to our proven track record of lasting and impactful success (both over the course of full campaigns and recently -- its a lot harder to get coverage now than it was six months ago, and we are still getting amazing results every day) as an indicator of what your investment might translate to in terms of output. 

I'll also repeat here what I have said elsewhere because I think it is staggeringly important when making a choice like this; ""The litmus test for a good PR firm is their ability to keep their client's so happy during the course of their contract that they sign to an extension past the initial contract period.""

Decred is not a company. The executive team = stakeholders. During development and this transition, the executive contractor is Company 0.

Overall, I'm a bit pessimistic about this proposal. $120,000 for six months seems too expensive. I don't think six months is enough time to develop a good marketing strategy built for the long term. If we decide to try them out, I would go with a trial phase and reduced budget. I'm looking forward to more comments and thoughts for other stakeholders.

1\.

> This proposal includes a strategic communications and events campaign for Decred

Who will run these events and pay for them?

Generally, is there any funding that may be required from Decred on top of this proposal's budget? If so, do you have an estimate?

2\.

> Wachsman will position Jake Yocom-Piatt as the primary spokesperson and media point of contact.

If too much attention is placed on Jake alone this can lead to decreased perceived decentralization of the project.

3\.

> Crisis Communications (...) limiting reputational impact

Interesting, I'd love to understand this better. Say we have an incident, like a 12 hour network stall, or a serious vulnerability discovered. What specific steps do you imagine to reduce the damage? Are there any historic examples?

4\. Looking at your connections, do you have an idea why Decred was omitted by CoinDesk for 2 years until recently, while extensively featuring projects with much less delivery?

5\. Do you have any connections to attract more talented Go developers? Is it in the scope of this proposal? Growing developer base is important for long term sustainability.

6\. Can you please comment on your influence in non-English space, and any plans in scope of this proposal?

7\. Will you allocate someone to talk to community in text chats and update how Wachsman-Decred project is doing?

8\. Do you make any activity on social media? For example, if someone tries to pull an info attack on Decred using multiple Twitter accounts?

9\. Can you use textual source formats (e.g. Markdown) for the materials you produce, and publish them on GitHub, to allow community members to contribute or re-use it in their work?

10\. Will you publish post-event analyses publicly?

11\. List of clients in the portfolio is impressive but only contains short descriptions of clients. Where can I learn about the actual work performed for them? Like a simple per-client list of actions taken, with some result analysis. linnutee asked a similar question with no reply so far.

12\. How to interpret all the linked articles? Are they written by Wachsman or did Wachsman assist in publishing?

13\. Why some of the linked articles feature Blockfolio and Ethereum while they are not in the list of clients? Also I'm puzzled by the ones featuring the giant rat and Roubini, is Bitcoin their 'client'?

14\. Did you work for Blockstream? (article about Liquid)

15\. Are the payments monthly?

16\. Is it possible to stop the (monthly) payments if stakeholders are not satisfied with the results after say 2-3 months? Or, alternatively, slowly ramp up the expenses based on deliverables. Asked a few times but answer so far.

17\. In one of the comments you mentioned due diligence services. That is interesting, could you e.g. help screening exchanges and wallets that integrate Decred?

18\. Was the call you had with Decred representatives recorded and is it available to the public?

19\. In case both Wachsman's and Ditto's proposals are approved, how do you feel about cooperating with Ditto?

20\. linnutee mentioned legal contracts, which contracts and with whom will be made?

On the text itself:

1. Please avoid using tracking bits in the links, e.g. `#1716b3851e51` in the forbes.com link or the `utm_xxx` in coindesk.com links. Anti-privacy tracking links are bad in general, but are even worse for a site that is visited by stakeholders.
2. `11.01.18 — 05.01.19`: please use international date format, month before day is [US-specific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country). By the way a good PR direction is to make Decred look less US-centric.

I think Jake is a great ambassador for Decred. I have also seen JZ and Marco do great interviews. I am comfortable expanding the number of Decred personalities to include all three and so that we can deliver a consistent message.  

We have lots of very smart people in Decred, and several could/should be projected as thought leaders in the crypto space. One reason why I happen to like Decred is because we have more than one heavyweight personalities with strengths in certain areas. 

The only issue that gave me pause on the proposal is the extensive list of crypto clients. Yes it's great they know crypto well. But clients include Dash and Horizen, which I might regard as competitors (even if I own some of the tokens on their client list). Would there be a conflict of interest? Probably not, but I want to raise the issue in case others can eliminate my doubts entirely or surface other concerns around that. 

The cost of the proposal, given the international reach and apparent connections to media and event organizers, seems reasonable (and yes, I have worked with brand and marketing agencies in different areas of the globe). If we can negotiate further, I am all for that --- but let's give marketing some serious attention. 

I recognize that we wouldn't be here discussing this if it was not for the outstanding work of our developers and programmers. But well placed marketing is also important - and we must have presence with both retail crypto investors and institutional investors - globally.

Signing with Wachsman means Decred does not have to worry about hiring an events team - we would cover you across the board from screening events, applying for speaking opportunities for your chosen representatives, helping with booth set up and ordering SWAG and more. The only thing Decred would have to worry about would be paying for the flights, hotel rooms, and tickets to the events themselves (although we are extremely good at securing discounts). For Decred specific events (hackathons, roadshows, etc.) we offer full support there as well.

> If too much attention is placed on Jake alone this can lead to decreased perceived decentralization of the project.

Ideally Jake would be one of many representatives - based on their area of expertise (i.e. a lead developer to talk to developer press). In a perfect world, a decentralized project wouldn’t have any centralized spokespeople - but in the current media and events landscape, they would be needed to communicate Decred’s story to the world and distinguish Decred from competitors. That said, Wachsman would work extremely hard to protect the decentralized nature of Decred -- it’s one of your best selling points and speaks to the very reason this industry was started in the first space! We would do this by working very closely with the community.

> What specific steps do you imagine to reduce the damage? Are there any historic examples?

There would be two main buckets here that would fall under our “rapid-response” engagement. 1. Manage, contain, and minimize negative publicity related to Decred, while developing a crisis strategy, contingency plan, and pre-approved drawer statements to prevent and mitigate any potential future crises. 2. Generate ongoing and regular content to strategically pitch Decred to media to ladder down negative articles about the network stall in organic searches. When in comes to historic examples, while I cannot share those (and certainly wouldn’t list a 12 hour network stall for Decred in future public discussions like this) examples of crises that Wachsman is prepared to help mitigate include: platform/token hacks, regulatory intervention, subpoena requests, unfulfilled company promises, staff departures, technology flaws, investor withdrawals, token offering extensions, sharp declines in token value, social media account takeovers, security breaches, and consistent community/developer/media criticisms.

> Do you have an idea why Decred was omitted by CoinDesk for 2 years until recently, while extensively featuring projects with much less delivery?

You can be the best project in the industry and be excluded from the media landscape entirely without the right team in place to change that. The bar for coverage in CoinDesk (a Wachsman client) has risen significantly in recent months - but we’re well prepared to navigate that (including suggesting to Decred that they offer the Politea announcement to Brady Dale under embargo). 

> Do you have any connections to attract more talented Go developers? Is it in the scope of this proposal? Growing developer base is important for long term sustainability.

Agreed 100 percent on the value of growing a developer base and there are several levers we can pull there. 1. A tailored media campaign to the publications we know developers are more likely to read. 2. A tailored events campaign to get Decred at the events we know developers are going to (including ones with job fairs) and supporting Decred in rolling out their own organic events - like hackathons for example. 3. Leveraging Wachsman’s Strategic Advisory Group that does this all the time. We didn’t list them in the day-to-day team members that will be supporting Decred because we didn’t want to misrepresent who will be supporting Decred daily, but this is an area that they would be well suited to help you with. As a bit of a background on them, they are headed up by Michael Chang and Franklin Bi. Michael previously served as Senior Vice President at Jefferies investment bank where he led the blockchain coverage effort. Prior to joining Wachsman, Franklin led the Blockchain Strategy group at JP Morgan. He helped lead the Quorum initiative and co-founded the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, among many other achievements. 

> Can you please comment on your influence in non-English space, and any plans in scope of this proposal?

One of the biggest focuses in hiring in our Singapore office has been fluency in other languages. While we focus primarily on English speaking media, we are well (and uniquely) suited to pitch Decred in other languages - we would likely rely on translation services for full releases however. 

> Will you allocate someone to talk to community in text chats and update how Wachsman-Decred project is doing?

Yes, absolutely. Decred’s community is one of the most important pillars of the project - we would look to include it across the board throughout this campaign. 

> Do you make any activity on social media? For example, if someone tries to pull an info attack on Decred using multiple Twitter accounts?

While (hopefully) this would not be part of our day to day activities, we would leverage our rapid response and crisis communications team to guide Decred through instances like this. 

> Can you use textual source formats (e.g. Markdown) for the materials you produce, and publish them on GitHub, to allow community members to contribute or re-use it in their work?

That’s a fantastic idea and certainly something we could look to do in the interest of keeping Decred’s community members as involved as possible. 

> Will you publish post-event analyses publicly?

Yes; happy to. 

> Where can I learn about the actual work performed for them? 

There is more info [attached in this slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11v242zQ3bhj3aDaoKM7ZsrKexRIsqwA4Aez4mzXnQAw/edit#slide=id.g46600410e6_0_0) that goes into a bit more detail the nature of our campaigns. Happy to elaborate on any specific use cases. 

> How to interpret all the linked articles? Are they written by Wachsman or did Wachsman assist in publishing?

In terms of the linked articles, Wachsman focuses entirely on “earned media” meaning we leveraged our relationships with reporters and industry knowledge to generate pitches that we then presented to individual reporters based on their interests who then generated organic content of their own based on it.",2f3417508e5816f5238b6181028ee2ecf124b55306106c992bab775d37a018d98bc883f4d9d5935dbf368050c9a034730bfdc25ac5c5429bd33169828fcded0b,2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443,70,118262eae35780fd360c095fa554e862e34c5361414615fc422c25f6e92bbbb9eada2a7cab0126b0db84420566addd813396a0bcae7c899250bad15686b4aa0a,1540912904,0,,False,cb9e6dde-b151-4a34-9317-e3136f0c8eee,tomcurranlevett,

These would fall under the idea of “expert commentary” -- leveraging industry trends or larger stories to insert commentary that further establishes Decred’s chosen representatives as wider industry experts -- not just Decred experts. This both keeps Decred regularly in the news and further establishes your representatives/Decred as one of the best and most experienced teams in the industry. 

> Did you work for Blockstream? (article about Liquid)

No, we have not. 

> Are the payments monthly?

Yes, they would be monthly.

> Is it possible to stop the (monthly) payments if stakeholders are not satisfied with the results after say 2-3 months? 

Yes, we have a standard 30 day out clause specifically to ensure stakeholders remain in control there. Frankly though, I would be shocked if you chose to use that clause. 

> In one of the comments you mentioned due diligence services. That is interesting, could you e.g. help screening exchanges and wallets that integrate Decred?

Yes, absolutely - that would be supported by the aforementioned Strategic Advisory Group. 

> Was the call you had with Decred representatives recorded and is it available to the public?

Not to my knowledge, but we would be supportive of the idea of doing so for all future calls in the interest of keeping Decred's community as informed as possible. 

> In case both Wachsman's and Ditto's proposals are approved, how do you feel about cooperating with Ditto?

Wachsman has worked with other PR firms in the past when our offerings were complimentary - working with a firm that focuses exclusively on Korean speaking media or reporters in the art vertical for example. In terms of working with another firm in the same space, I would have to echo Ditto's thoughts there - it would likely be redundant.

> When in comes to historic examples, while I cannot share those (and certainly wouldn’t list a 12 hour network stall for Decred in future public discussions like this)

I think here you mean carrying communication with other clients to not make Decred look bad. That's reasonable.

I'd only like to note that I see no problem talking about incidents in public. The 12 hour example was made up, but we had a real 9 hour stall recently. As seen [here](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/blocks?height=127080&rows=40), block 127072 was mined 9 hours after its parent. It was due to a sudden spike in hashrate, which is a good thing. Delayed transactions are not cool, but they were the only problem. All core software behaved as expected.

Cryptocurrencies do have incidents, post-mortems are openly published, and personally I find them as a good way to know the projects better by watching how their teams react. For example, the [report](https://www.dash.org/2017/03/08/DDoSReport.html) of the DoS attack on DASH left a good impression: the issue was handled rather fast, a report was posted, and a message saying ""there are people out there monitoring all the time"" conveyed.

> suggesting to Decred that they offer the Politea announcement to Brady Dale under embargo

Embargo?

> Can you elaborate on this question? (legal contracts)

Sorry this is me still wrapping my head around some aspects of Politeia. When discussing conflicts of interest, linnutee suggested that separation of employees working for different accounts ""needs to be heavily covered in the legal contracts"". That left me wondering if there are any contracts that Wachsman will sign with Decred, and what entity will be on the Decred side. I guess it is DHG.",36bf8e8f8bd233df2dcd800e9d54262858a917d05ec8ca9537e1d89c49c002f17fd995abc417a552f542861a06e556497f69e412ca3d0df5c57fb9ed5b04e201,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,72,bbf7e581ad236d3d63f9c25084a5a70461cb3222a0bb4c221040b76646799099f65558cd9f2bb90c4a8a431819661b121e595e521822b1c9040eed5dc8e81a0f,1540980934,0,,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

Correct, a lot of crisis communications includes minimizing coverage of the story as much as possible - or at the very least getting ahead of it so that when incidents do go public, like the DoS attack on DASH, we can control the narrative around those incidinents. Part of that minimizing coverage as much as possible means that we would do our best to prevent it from being brought up again at a later date — and as such wouldn't use it in public discussions down the line. 

> Embargo?

A lot of mainstream reporters — particularly those in this industry — won't go near news that has already been ""broken,"" meaning if a story about Politeia going live has already been picked up by a number of the smaller trade outlets, they won't go near them. With stories of this nature, Wachsman would bring the news to a very selected (and trusted) number of reporters in the space that we know will not break the story early. This allows major reporters to do their dilligence, have interviews with relevant parties, and fold coverage into their own editorial calendars ahead of us distributing the news far and wide at a pre-selected date. An example of this was eToro's launch into the United States. The Wachsman PR and Events teams worked for several weeks under embargo with top-tier reporters so that when Yoni Assia was on stage at Consensus announcing that they were launching in the American crypto market, several top tier articles went live at the exact same time.

> Separation of employees working for different accounts ""needs to be heavily covered in the legal contracts

I picked up on a lot of flashy ""marketing"" terms (no surprise there) and I'm always skeptical of marketing services in general. I would encourage others to also be skeptical of a marketing proposal offered by a marketing company (sorry Wachsman, but I know how marketing is). I do agree with the others who have suggested that Decred should have more general marketing services, but this proposal just comes off to me as an expensive ""brand in a box"" subscription service.

A lot of the services offered are ones I doubt will even get used, and I don't think we need much assistance when it comes to event strategies - our current event group seems to be doing just fine.

Honestly, I was quite impressed with your proposal until I got down to the ""When"" part. Paying out in fiat is a huge deal-breaker for me.

I understand there is a risk involved when accepting crypto payment, especially when dealing with a 6-month contract. If DCR suffers a catastrophic event that puts the price into a significant downturn, you're stuck with a contract to fulfill, accepting money that's loosing value every day. As has been mentioned in some of the other comments here, there is also concerns about the 90-day out clause.

May I suggest modifying this proposal to have monthly payouts of DCR, with the option for either party (the Decred stakeholders or Ditto) to terminate the relationship at the close of any given month (perhaps with a requirement of 15 or 30-day notice)? 
- This gives you the leeway to terminate the contract if you're no longer comfortable accepting DCR for payment.
- This also gives the stakeholders an option to opt-out if expected results are not delivered. Stakeholder opt-out would be made in the form of a new Politeia proposal terminating the relationship.",3d6f7585b6085f26dc09e8c198c866d5a72038f4c2ce3d41cf42187c55e714b05ac8fea25c3771d579f6d47882ea6de0a9ac7fcff465304a1757afaf1028f50f,1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106,12,b4fba50e7b8d0f0b1d49250eca3ddad3c4e71af6b01aa159c7696ebd92921320b342ed672f584d7ae2958e56177c83998f7a41829abfb2e37d5fcf19abcc0007,1540250595,5,5.0,False,8b7137f1-bb9e-46a3-bb20-f9750863aeec,ryanzim,

The Decred devs and team members are doing an enormous job at the moment with all the work being done; balancing their precious time between coding, testing, speaking about Decred, writing material, answering questions, attending events and being active on various platforms.

How would your firm specifically help or provide assistance, so that the team can remain efficient in those tasks while increasing visibility?

One of the things I’ve noticed when companies meet with us is they say, “You know, our last PR firm had good ideas but it just translated to more work for us. And we don’t have time to do all that.” We pride ourselves in making sure Ditto does all the heavy lifting. Doesn’t mean we won’t need some of your valuable time. But it’s also why we are considered the “anti PR Agency.” We do things the right way, which isn’t how other PR firms do it.

A good PR plan actually takes time OFF your schedule. If we create a smart plan, prioritize, etc., Ditto can then execute without having to bother you too much. I’d argue a good PR plan maximizes the time you have – not add on more time. And it’s why we don’t charge by the hour, like most PR firms. We’d much rather get BIG results in less time than the opposite of that.

Backing up a little more, we work with developers ranging from coding bootcamps to founders to blockchain companies. So, we understand how to work with devs. Also, we are a new source for your community. A dev may have a question about something PR related, and Ditto is 24/7 on demand to answer any and everything.

This is the only item I have some concerns about. There are three people listed in the team with mostly directional roles, however none with a dedicated focus on creative copywriting or a creative strategy work. (These are marked as secondary roles.)
Working out key messaging + a communications strategy and documenting it in a reasonable way has been an item that I've discussed with 2 or 3 no longer present marketing contributors, of who none successfully delivered any useful results. So this should not be taken lightly.
Although DCR has a number of excellent in-house writers, I would say we've always been missing the creative copywriting types. The issue here is that documentation writing, research writings, journalism writings and creative copywriting are all very different animals. A lot of the comms. output so far has been written by a group. Comparing it objectively to brands who have it created by dedicated professionals – these will never be on the same level.
When it comes to creative copywriting, communication strategy creation and such – to get something actually useful worked out in DCR's context, this task absolutely needs at least one specialized senior level copywriter (or creative director, strategist whatever the title w/ similar background) with a strong, demonstrable track-record (e.g. case studies). Reason being that the scope itself is already way too big for a non-dedicated or directional roles to cover: building an deep understanding, creating objectives and devising strategies to accomplish them, concepting work, creative problem solving, imaginativness and eye for detail, going in-depth with calibrating the voice and articulations, having an understanding of various aspects of branding, awarness and ability to tell difference between short lived trends and timeless techniques, strong judgement and projection skills on outcomes, ability to sync with the design direction, etc… You get my point.
Also in case there's plan of using shadow-writers to assist the key personnel – this has been tried and did not work well. I'm in favour of the actual people doing the work being behind the table and accountable.
This essentially will work as a tool and a standard for everyone who wants to communicate about Decred – meaning that tangible deliverables and well accessible documentation of the work are of importance here. For one potential benchmark, I would suggest to take a look at the project https://brand.estonia.ee/story/core-messages/ where quite reasonable communication guidelines were developed for a large (and obviously even harder to define) entity – this being a country, but it's end use case is similar to DCR as it's meant for very different businesses and individuals.
Obviously one of the most difficult parts of the project will be getting the ultimate agreement on what goes. I'm well aware that having too many cooks in the kitchen will mess up the work and I obviously don't recommend this. Preferably the concept development process could include a small number of expert contributors covering the key disciplines of the projects. Only once a rough consensus on a solution is agreed, this can be brought out for larger reviewing. Also type of involvement, tasks and responsibilities for each participant should be well defined from the start to.”

From what i’ve seen at dittopr.co, the case studies are very oriented towards the statistical/reach and journalism outputs. I would be rather interested in seeing work that demonstrates more tangible outputs of creative problem solving, thought and strategic ability, and even sheer writing ability, and this being in a brands context rather than only journalism. Ideally this should relate to the expected outputs planned for Decred and have the work talk for itself. 

Considering the Wachsmans competitive proposal is up also, what would you consider your main edge on them? 

Thanks.",4327c6d713b7de22835411e927f21342ad28157be2f6290fbce4623aaac13eb19ff9779ba192a0d2b77a374398f262d62aa7fb161d77367ee5575439f52b0304,23fe3a8aae4b6234a2bc15b2dbe9973e13287ed0849fbd5e3fd743709c737b73,22,fbe144c37bdd54410c0959bc93468b8d0b74aa3039327ab65f472d017dbfc456427da2afc62a9e743d066c91c6acb975f88cf80b73599e423250f05e1133aa02,1540330293,4,4.0,False,ba96e181-abff-4c1a-b2be-9bb916ea4083,linnutee,

“Positioning, messaging and talking points” is probably one of the most important things Ditto does for its blockchain clients. I’d add “media training,” as well.

What you say and how you say it is critical to achieve what we are trying to accomplish. And from Ledger to Origin to Monero to Kadena, we spent a lot of time early on working on this. For some clients, it was more about what they say to different audiences. For other clients, it was about simply coming up with one document on “how to explain ourselves.” We’ve been doing that a lot recently. In a decentralized company, we’d like for everyone to be able to explain who they work for as similarly as possible. That is important not only for journalists, but for internal purposes, as well.

A lot of the founders we work with – many, if not most, are devs – have never done an interview before. So we need to make sure that 1) they know what to say and 2) they are comfortable conducting an interview. That’s why media training is important. We want to make sure that when you talk to anyone from CoinDesk to The New York Times (which you will), you crush it.

I hope that answers one part of your question.

Moving on…

Trey, who founded Ditto, was originally a reporter at the Associated Press. Writing will always be important at Ditto. In fact, we recently hired a VP Kris Kitto, who was also a reporter in Washington D.C. Kris oversees content at Ditto and regularly teaches the rest of us how to be a better writer. Everyone at Ditto is expected to be a good writer. That’s also because we are generalists, meaning we pride ourselves on being good at all the core tenets of PR. Ditto isn’t for everyone. There are PR people out there who JUST want to manage clients or JUST do media relations. A lot of us have some kind of specialty, but we are pretty freakin’ good at all the core communications offerings.

Also, Ditto is top heavy, meaning most of us are senior-level PR people. Every account has a team that can think strategically, give good advice, and execute a plan. The biggest complaint we get from incoming clients looking for a new PR firm is the “bait and switch.” Sold by senior PR execs, only to get handed off to junior people. We are about 80+% super smart senior PR people. You just don’t get that at other PR firms, where pitching is relegated to junior people and some senior people only do strategy. Not at Ditto. You can see that from the team we proposed. I don’t want to talk too much about Wachsman, who I respect and talk to regularly, but Ditto is outspoken about what makes us different and better, and I think this is an important differentiator to point out. Our team is senior-level PR people. We don’t staff our accounts with one person who’s just good at events, and one senior person who would probably just “manage.” That’s just not how we operate… and it’s working!

A bit of “how the sausage is made:” Every account is required to come up with one smart idea every month. What does that mean? It means strategic advice is mandatory at Ditto. It means that we are thinkers and doers.

I wish we had time to update some of our case studies, but we’ve been busy on client work. That’s another difference between Ditto and our competitors. We are a bunch of super smart PR folks who do a ton of crypto and blockchain work. Every client is important, and every week we bust our ass to give them good counsel and get them the awareness they deserve. Big PR firms have sales people and marketing people who can create case studies on messaging to make them sound good. We just haven’t had the time to do that yet.",e4fc46d30ed2805f070aa14d9f851ee1d04a3c01118a453e09db9f00af97f554d544adfd759151d1e7b4d6f1c8b00187b7b8f7855058f14a4c85cc916251220d,9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc,23,342362d87853e0a9e128f535d51b701e45c9a89c6361badaa97ae001bcdaec190082885b892526e4e52c9ee78a56919fd776d123c08a882fffdcdc1a2e065008,1540342057,2,3.0,False,49d74e49-6be8-4ff3-8687-00e0bcb6da44,blainr,1.0

Why not, simply lay out a separate contract between you and that party to process the DCR <=> USD exhange according to the terms agreed and remove the USD requirement from this proposal?

Otherwise, the problem I see is that the Decred entity itself has no central authority and cannot for example, open a bank account and process USD payments.

The various stakeholders like myself, who together form this decentralized entity, only have the ability to allow DCR payments from the treasury by voting on proposals. So you may find difficult to have them agree to enter a contract in which they are required to do something impossible (make payments in USD).

Furthermore, as the goal is to eventually have payments made automatically using a smart contract based on votes, this kind of DCR/USD arrangements in a proposal will eventually not be possible anymore unless an intermediary makes the proposal in DCR, and then contract the services is USD.

Finally one danger of leaving the proposal ""as is"", is that it leaves the impression for future proposal, that the treasury can be disbursed to contractors in USD (which is technically false and can only be achieved with a third party).",53a224b2da5ff904946ddde17b96df527d4abd71107139e4629b7601b7caa97348e85b7b60488352478e2f34a0ddfe8e346c61a47e9b0f5b591bb921021d5307,0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9,24,6d103862d992de73de4b9cabb67c5241dd72661910c363b92ae5596d829a4049b1a8fdcc1c61e2945ab243880d80c0a7744cdaea300d8f702e0369830f7fd101,1540342294,1,1.0,False,3ffa2992-ace9-4a7d-abce-51872469e765,nnnko56,

I feel some important details are still left out of the proposal. Before I can make up my mind on how to vote I have a few questions and remarks, some more fundamental to Decred in general than others.

First off, how do you envision your impact on Decred after the contract is over? And to be more precise on this point, what are you deliverables? How, as stakeholders, do we test your performance? Where and in what manner will you report? How do we hold you accountable? This is important to know, because how otherwise do we make use of the opt-out clause.

Who is paying the Decred representatives you media train? Who selects these representatives? Will they be paid from this budget? Will event registration fees and other associated costs (like hotel, etc) that you arrange be paid from this budget?

And as a more fundamental question tied to this, who are the people that are representing Decred? We have yet to see a proposal in the spirit of 'I want to represent Decred at events,' or 'this company/group of people wants to take care of event representation and presence.'
Are you proposing to train Company 0 employees or freelancers or your own employees?

Then as others have asked in both this proposal and the other marketing one, (why) do you think Decred needs your entire proposed suite of services for a relatively short 6-month period?",13d62bbfcd360e236e33f157c27f6cb449b160af56b1c0873205e41288bc4b6b6295b3ec2fbc9ece70315322f240fbce1632d5aa6661aaeecb5125166e66140f,00c09bb145ae4ddf1d5ec5a6a80e2697d081e8cf906600c3fca7a9f0e2dca0ab,31,53861a2da20cc0daa8f60c1d9dbd597f6e15d69ba7e89940405b9363c21f90274889cc862f49c2501ddd51232251eea244e5614eb13c524dfa7566c9a4adad09,1540469720,1,1.0,False,e2309a22-74b9-4311-b14e-bbb841be19a0,clwys,

It starts by aligning on KPIs and objectives, which will be determined as part of the onboarding process. We’ve already talked about some of the objectives that the community believes are important, but we’ll want to get specific. For instance: How many pieces of coverage per month, how many pieces of content we will produce, how many events per quarter, etc.  That said, we only propose what we think a client needs.

Things we think about:
1) Expert sourcing – When reporters write about governance issues they should be quoting someone from Decred
2) Proactive pitching – Identify monthly issues/topics relevant to Decred that will generate media coverage
3) Quality vs. quantity – We want to balance top tier crypto (CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, etc.) with top tier mainstream (NYT, WSJ, Laura Shin, Bloomberg)
4) Decred features – What story lines provide us opportunities to get those bigger stories? We should always be thinking big.
5) News announcements – Do we want to get one really good story through an exclusive, or do we reach out to a handful of reporters?

Once we align in understanding where there is opportunity, we can then layout expected outputs. Ballpark, we tend to get 5-10 pieces of coverage each month for our crypto clients. Where there’s news, it’s even higher.

Onboarding takes no more than 30 days, ideally. This is some of the most important foundation work we will do. This includes messaging, identifying topics/issues Decred should be talking about, looking at any upcoming announcements, news opportunities, etc. We are a results-focused PR firm, so we love outputs and deliverables.

We tend to have a weekly check-in with our clients. Most of that is accountability: What have we done this week, what are we doing next week. Also, there’s some accountability on the client side: We need X and Y from you (without creating too much extra work on your end). Again, this is a partnership.

What we are most eager to get to is the harder results: media coverage, securing speaking engagements, publishing op-eds, etc. One of the things our team couldn’t stand while working at bigger, global PR firms was 30, 60, 90 days into a new client, the firm was still “strategizing” and “creating memos,” but the client was like “Yeah, but where are the results??” There’s a lot of important foundational work to be done, but Ditto is always eager to “go external.”

I would check with Dustin from Decred on additional fees. Things like travel and conference fees are not traditionally included in PR plans. Also, on who is representing Decred. That would be part of what we’d hope to discover during the onboarding process. The same is true for media training. Once we identify who or whom will be representing Decred from an external standpoint, we will train them on certain aspects of how to engage with the media that will hopefully ensure leads to coverage with the right message being conveyed. All media training is included in the price of the monthly agreement.",9a1bb3540602f91bc0668c686abf1a0ef53095b869f8b2f64d417551132bedcaaab2500ec74143fe3ad85dfbd0cde3b8407cced4f7aa9d55964171d89e1a0704,9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc,32,bd39c1c6de7bbebb08615a34e9a09c5adca7f397b3ec85c92684863869ce0d1585de8805a308ee46b4c34a330c5f935edefaf7f30b7d8489cf24889e0a868c01,1540487434,1,1.0,False,49d74e49-6be8-4ff3-8687-00e0bcb6da44,blainr,

**First, what are the main differences between Wachsman and Ditto?**

This is a really good and important question. As we alluded to in our proposal on Politeia, Ditto is very much an “anti-PR firm” in that we fundamentally believe the traditional business model of PR firms is broken.

Firstly, everyone at Ditto has a technical level of expertise and understands the nuances of blockchain/crypto in a way that far surpasses our competitors.

Secondly, we understand your culture and your community, and we share your values. We’ve worked with decentralized communities like Monero that place a premium on privacy and unanimity. We’ve listened to the feedback the community has given, and we’ve made the necessary adjustments. We understand and appreciate the unique characteristics that make the Decred community what it is, which will translate into the right kind of advice and partnership when it comes time to do the work, versus more traditional marketing tactics or buzzwords.

The third and most important differentiator is results. We believe in radical honestly and transparency and will only tell you what we believe to be possible. What you see is what you get, and we’re happy to provide a synopsis of the results we’ve gotten over the years. Our vast network of reporters and the relationships we have in the media value this, as well. So when we pitch a story or reach out to a journalist, they know and appreciate the companies that work with Ditto are of the highest legitimacy and credibility.

Finally, Ditto is top heavy, meaning most of us are senior-level PR people. Every account has a team that can think strategically, give good advice, and execute a plan. The biggest complaint we get from incoming clients looking for a new PR firm is the “bait and switch.” Sold by senior PR execs, only to get handed off to junior people. We are about 80+% super smart senior PR people. You just don’t get that at other PR firms, where pitching is relegated to junior people and some senior people only do strategy. Not at Ditto. You can see that from the team we proposed (more on that in a bit).

**Next question: Can you justify the 5k extra that Ditto is asking for compared to Wachsman?**

As outlined in our conversations with the Decred community prior to this process, the fee matches the proposed scope of work. Content, media relations, conferences/events, thought leadership, and the amount of time and resources we would devote to this led us to $25K in DCR. If it is determined that the community only wants content and media relations, as opposed to conferences and events, we can adjust the proposal and the price accordingly. I also want to point out that both our CEO Trey Ditto and myself — the two most senior people at Ditto — will staff the account and give you personalized attention.

**Next question: I see you have a Monero as one of your clients. Someone asked Ricardo his involvement with ditto and he mentioned that he worked with your company on a personal level not with Monero. Could you please elaborate.**

We worked with Monero around their Project Coral Reef announcement, and we were subsequently hired by Tari, a project by Ric and Naveen. That, to us, indicates that they were pleased with the level of service we provided and hired us for a launch announcement that was widely covered. It’s worth noting, like with a lot of clients, we do know Ric on a personal level, as well. We are partners with our clients. By the way, here’s [an article]( http://fortune.com/2018/05/23/crypto-blockchain-monero-ticketfly-project-tari/) we generated in Fortune for the Tari announcement and here’s [an article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/12/05/cryptocurrency-monero-to-be-accepted-by-musicians-such-as-mariah-carey-g-eazy-sia-for-holidays/#1955c93060eb) we generated in Forbes for Monero. There we of course multiple other outlets that covered this news.  

**And finally: Would you be able to provide a list of Ditto team members who we can expect to interact with on a daily basis?**

The Ditto team members who would interact with you on a regular basis are the ones listed in our proposal: our CEO Trey Ditto, Managing Director Blain Rethmeier, Vice President Margaret Huang, Account Executive Milvian Prieto, and Associate Vice President Liz Bagot.",1e00a6419d34f50b3471688092ebc0c3b95482f18387ec51a14000be7579e21c9b8c3563d38041f859475bfa95f931ef9ff7e151d335dabfffa2dc347f7f6a02,9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc,33,b3f9a71a0b810e70ddbb3d4731bf9a6fef8382667394db6224286b116e2e7e785a1f37508748f0ea094eacd4123bc14c548dd21e3fa67d2e85f1d7efdb4cd50a,1540494071,2,2.0,False,49d74e49-6be8-4ff3-8687-00e0bcb6da44,blainr,
27,27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50,0,"When Ditto compares ourselves to almost every other PR firm, results are what differentiates us. But if we are being honest, one of the reasons Ditto and Wachsman are the top two crypto PR firms out there is because of our results. Top tier results are what we have in common! That’s good news for Decred.

So, [here’s a smattering of coverage](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qPcDM7hjwgNDxlkQOmZ3ChW2EQzbtBl6wpHZZk4_1Mo/edit?usp=sharing) we’ve secured for some of crypto clients over the past year. 

We chose the past year as the timeframe because we want to show that we didn’t just have a lucky couple of weeks — this is month over month consistency and delivering on what we promised. And we chose a handful of clients and just a sampling of coverage because that should show you that media coverage is one of the things we are good at.

But even in the past week, clients have had features in everything from _CoinDesk_ to _SF Business Times_ to _Bloomberg TV_ to _Breaker Magazine_ to _The Block_. We could be here all day just going through “media hits”!

When I look at our list and Wachsman’s list, there are a few differences: Ditto has a much more robust mix of national TV, top tier crypto, and top tier mainstream. Don’t get me wrong — there are some Tier 2/3, but our coverage seems a little more elevated.

Also, the final thing I’d add, just looking at Wachsman’s coverage, is that they have a lot of stories written by contributors, whereas we tend to work directly with staff reporters. One, working directly with reporters means more people will read the story. Two — and we aren’t saying this is the case — but a lot of contributors are pay-to-play. That’s just not our style.

In the interest of moving beyond just getting clients hits, there’s a backstory to every time a client is in the news. What went into that?

1)    **Being proactive** – Ditto saw a trend in the industry and positioned the client

2)    **Important issues** – Clients have issues/topics (community, scaling, speed, security, etc.), and we keep them in the news on those issues

3)    **Messaging** – We put in the time to make sure we are relaying to the media the clients’ stories in a way that ensures positive coverage

4)    **Talking Points** – Before any interview, we think about, “What do we want to say in this specific interview to get our point across?”

5)    **Media training** – Could be as simple as a quick mock interview the day before, but we make sure the client is as ready as possible

So, while we can just look at volume and quality, at Ditto, there’s a lot more care that goes into what ends up being printed.",0421a68e06a351ba0c62a1d7d7f56480859b99f1da69577769664e0ce2e71eb76186368917c218f5ecfc531d1c023e636e97fac0ae3a4fd8363797d53501ed0a,9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc,34,63c686853241c4a50ce57307743fac459d1ca7eb3e806cace415d4472afec00972c02321731d2fd3c190c8188f1d0dca0c0362a72e12ee5c596d67251bcf030b,1540503319,1,2.0,False,49d74e49-6be8-4ff3-8687-00e0bcb6da44,blainr,1.0

You made an important point, and something we try to achieve in our work: Whatever we do should tie back to an objective or a goal. We will need to work with the community to determine which specific metrics Decred wants to impact so that we can measure them — and this is something we will want to determine at the very beginning of our relationship.

The plan we laid out focuses on community growth and engagement by raising your visibility, elevating your brand and better defining your value proposition to externally facing audiences.

Metrics aside, there is something to be said about overall “awareness.” Many of our clients who have never done PR before say “We just want the community to know about us more.” And a lot of that work is targeting devs and the crypto community. It’s hard to measure awareness, although we utilize a few platforms to gauge traction of stories. And we are constantly monitoring what is and isn’t working and making adjustments.

Regarding timing, we can’t think of a better time than now. Politeia is live, and we’re at the very beginning of a revolution. PR now will help drive awareness, facilitate development, and increase awareness of future Decred updates. It’s important to get started as early as possible — especially now that the product is live and working, and real proposals are being written and voted on.

How do you guys at Ditto measure success internally?

Can you provide some guidance on how Decred could come up with  success measures we can establish up front to set concrete expectations, and set targets you can measure yourselves against so that success is not solely subjective and ambiguous? 

Any examples of top client interactions that were the most successful and why would be helpful.",bbd44563e47a3813a6515bdc231d0d5c6b665e1e4c7e6f5926beaa72dd8c7f255922eb5f70629d66214dbad7a6f7e2f4a7510f6edbcacd74ec6f9b03b9aac606,6b19278a1e5a3a21e44da5377c6ded5a91862126d18c8e08a2370affe715537d,37,6cbbeb9d9bd66afac2de2183318418b5bc6bfe73a6d36a7e48da64d1b8c7bfbefbae7c5d90e555968bfa507527e7d8823c7b06cc5d09fe219705f8e000590d0d,1540656111,2,2.0,False,a938351b-56ae-420c-b4d6-04c4d3f89966,nottrunner,

Every month client teams come together and set their metrics that align with each client. Every account is different, but it basically includes: quantity and quality of media coverage, content written and published and one what we call an “extended communication” (social media, speaking, award submission, partnership, etc.). 

As we have said in other comments, we believe in going much farther than outputs, which we are really good at. We also measure quality of service. Every account has to come together and send the client one “smart idea” each month. This pushes us to be creative, proactive and always trying something new. 

The best feedback we got once was from Avi Flombaum, co-founder of Flatiron School: Every month Ditto sent us a new idea, pushing us to stay ahead. We didn’t act on many of them, which was more an internal thing on our end, but it showed us that Ditto understood our business and was always thinking about us. 

Finally, we have a “client facing” section, meaning we should be talking to the client on a personal and professional level every month. Again, we are your partner! Our internal metrics – which Trey has to approve – are historically higher than what the client expects. Here’s the fun part: Every team that does all these things: hits their outputs, sends a creative idea and interacts with the client gets a bonus at the end of the month.

It’s why Ditto is a better PR firm. We believe in doing high quality, high output work and then rewarding staffers for doing killer work.

Examples of interactions. First, I’m happy to put you in touch with Avi from Flatiron School. They were a client for 4 years – until WeWork bought them. It’s the perfect example of Ditto:
1) Lifelong partners – As I said above, it was a deep partnership where we cared about them and vice versa. Trey and Avi became best friends in fact.
2) Month over month results – for 4 years, they averaged 100+ stories every year.
3) High quality – They were front page WSJ, Business Section B1 of NYT, on national TV 4+ times a year.
4) Results attached to business – When we got them coverage, website traffic spiked and sign-ups happened.
5) Positioning – Flatiron School went from maybe #4 coding bootcamp in the country to #1 based on our work and their high quality service.

We have crypto examples too:
- [CoinList](https://www.dittopr.co/portfolio-item/coinlist/)
- [Monero](https://www.dittopr.co/portfolio-item/monero/)

We need to do some more crypto case studies. Just been too busy doing PR work than marketing ourselves. Hopefully you understand we balance strategy, quality, quantity and client relations better than anyone else.

We would set Decred targets in our onboarding meeting. Something super easy to set now is Decred will be interviewed and get media coverage in the top crypto and mainstream publications. From _CoinDesk_ to _New York Times_ to Laura Shin's podcast, we can promise that Decred will gain recognition in all top tier outlets. We are confident about this because all of our clients (as you saw in our media coverage examples) get this attention. 

For events, we’d like to see Decred have an elevated presence. This means speaking at the high-quality crypto conferences. This does NOT mean having booth babes and going to conferences that are a waste of time.",4d36bf83c7bb5e9a107f6a1420120a157dc2f3045dc3e4d4bb49942fe3d5ca366ffd48ea039bb26042a25481326543d29f2c0a6c3b2740f961b098e945540405,9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc,38,520cfcb25e268dba89dfe0d62777b4f4f64acf75fa0f1ca45bd8985498cef65d183d9cad8a480f1b07b96a77ac425ae563ffa04dff8b511db016f76f4abcf10e,1540680285,2,2.0,False,49d74e49-6be8-4ff3-8687-00e0bcb6da44,blainr,

1. I think the Decred marketing team is doing a good job with the selection of events we appear at. Mind you, though your team can point to numerous events and conferences in the crypto space does not mean that their profiles necessarily aligns with Decred's goals, e.g. attending buzzwordy conferences with 95% ICO in attendance.
2. An apparent no prior interest in Decred and disbursement of 2/3rds of monthly funds for the campaign in fiat does highlight a lack of belief in the success of the project; the 1/3rd payable in DCR being a ""safe"" investment for when/if it makes it big.

I really like this one. For the past 2 years, the ""major media"" was acting weird in relation to Decred. They kept rehashing governance issues and seemed to recognize the problem, but never reached for comment to a project that has delivered so much with most pragmatic and sane approach.

My counter of materials who ""omitted"" Decred is currently at 74 and I made a few theories, but the main point is, if this ever changes it will be a big win for the project.

What I'd love to see is: when a reporter is writing about governance issues, first they ask the project who delivered most while raising least money, and managed to avoid problems by farsighted vision.",8b0120fd2737c75d2a45c28b68a0a7ef373937db2a63fc2b5e92c22a2f5c6b6703b94fa48eb69224880b5b9ccfb11b1ca757625e0fe1b307e9283836ef81b108,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,41,7f3ad0a888a457cefeae7a46a5c1f00c87636cfb00878655bb92e61c6ff24985f2751392ad5e0f62feabdd484c2af0bf3db018c881cd419ddbbad4cc03cf7700,1540899703,0,,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

1\. In case both your and Wachsman's proposals are approved, how do you feel about cooperating with them?

2\. What do you think about using textual source formats (e.g. Markdown) for (some)  materials you produce, and publish them on GitHub, to allow community members to contribute or re-use it in their work?

3\. Do you have influence in non-English space, and any plans in relation to it in the scope of this proposal?

4\. What do you think about ""anti-events"" when instead of (or in addition to) high profile, paid, expensive events that only crypto geeks attend, you go straight to the people. Example is what Raedah Group (Decred's contractor) did [in Portland](https://twitter.com/raedahgroup).

5\. Do you have any connections to attract more talented developers? Any such plans in the scope of this proposal? Growing developer base is important for long term sustainability.

6\. Will there be any legal contracts? With whom?

1.    Trey answered this on Reddit and our counsel is that we don’t believe you need two PR firms. But we have worked with other PR firms with other clients in the past (typically the other firm has a very specific focus separate from ours), and it worked out.

2.    We think creating materials that have maximum utility is important and sharing is going to be important to this campaign — and there will definitely be times where we should get the Decred community’s insight.

3.    We do quite a bit of work in Asia — we have a couple of Chinese clients, just finished helping launch Ledger’s Hong Kong office, and have helped facilitate interviews in Chinese. Additionally, we have relationships with the Russian media. I think once we get a good work flow going and we earn your trust and prove ourselves, we should as quickly as possible add that on. A lot of the U.S. media is translated and read by China, Japan, Korea, Russia, etc.

4.    You’re right — there is so much noise at conferences and events. A lot of our clients don’t even have the budget – or desire – to pay to play. We should definitely think about how to “hijack” a conference and develop an ""anti-event"" strategy.  

5.    Trey also just touched on this on Reddit. I think much of the work we will do will better define Decred and elevate awareness of Decred within the Dev community. But at some point, we have to think of more direct ways to get in front of devs. That will definitely be part of our campaign, and we’d want to listen and talk to you all to figure out the best way to do it.

6.    Dustin is probably the best person to answer that question. But yes, there will be a contract.",2d131ed087432ecb7e5ba19bdb919493ea0816a66ceb00b79535c0f73f21d44b6e704e9650370b7129cbdc753ca55cac56d51782ff203cb7fe0ec1366e8c7809,9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc,44,0af1c1b6655087b04b6ccc5358ef8b286d1bbfa58b2082324f15e814d510ebcdcead55fdd2542f345ac6e651e06c820cb307571cb5470c9292ee07d2f165c206,1540919670,0,,False,49d74e49-6be8-4ff3-8687-00e0bcb6da44,blainr,

We did help rewrite the Politea press release, which resulted from several productive conversations with multiple Decred members over the past few weeks. You can see the final result [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181016005342/en/Decred-Launches-Politeia-Self-Governance-System-Release-20-Million).

Importantly, Ditto was founded on “introductory retainers,” which means proving ourselves and growing. From what we understand, though, there’s a lot of work to be done. We are firm believers in only proposing what a client truly needs (and what we know we can succeed at). And sometimes that means doing one thing really well and growing from there.

Six months is a pretty standard length for a PR campaign — it’s what you’ll encounter with just about any firm you work with. We do offer a 90 day termination clause, meaning if we don’t do what we said we would do in the first 90 days, you have every right to fire us. Honestly, no one has ever utilized that clause.

One more point about our prior experience. We have worked with many serious projects with a long-term roadmap — everyone from Monero to Augur to Chronicled to Origin to Kadena to CoinList – the list goes on. We are a PR firm that has proven itself in the past two years as a team that knows blockchain.

Also, we pride ourselves on being capable of handling as much of the work as possible. Other PR firms definitely aren’t like that. We will request a thorough onboarding and be true partners moving forward, meaning we will be doing most of the work. Our ability to do this is because we deeply understand blockchain and Decred’s value more than your typical PR firm.",f44334ca5e6cc11c6933562eb3f63b7df7a5c7687179296e0ef21c0dd29f7367bb26b6630ab2be6304f6de51cddd92373ea8066637f16a959fc19457565bd006,9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc,7,09a645f267511d55f1ec94f408a0ead1906f1b6b6e9d294751375b8a21899062d471bda5aef44941d3fc3e9b2b89f57ca7288667169444e0ecdab5324b9e740d,1540249309,2,2.0,False,49d74e49-6be8-4ff3-8687-00e0bcb6da44,blainr,

I’m not sure accepting fiat shows a lack of confidence in Decred, though. It just means our centralized rent is due every month in USD. :)
 
For the record, we followed this same payment structure with Monero. 
 
In regards to the termination clause, I think it’s fair for both parties to say we are going to give this a shot for 90 days.

We can help with speaking slots, talking to media at the conferences, etc. We can probably even suggest a few conferences you haven’t thought of that our other blockchain clients attend. So it’s more about making what you are already doing even better. 
 
Just to clarify a few things, we of course have had prior interest in Decred. But we have never actually worked with Decred, except on refining the press release.

Basically, a submission would be placed after work is complete:

1. That depends on one's epistemological perspective I guess, along with the specific research question and methods. The purpose of collecting data and sharing it openly along with the analysis is to allow people to reproduce it and test alternative hypotheses. 
2. In my view the second proposal will be this opportunity. If I fell like this is going badly I will not make a second proposal and may end this first one before the budget is spent. Stakeholders will vote to decide if it should be an ongoing program by approving or rejecting the second proposal. I think that's about the right level for stakeholder approval of the program as a whole.
3. I'm not sure that estimating the total number of hours to be worked is going to help with estimating how many questions can be covered. That depends on the difficulty of the question and how deep the answer goes. The program will require a way for stakeholders to feed back on the quality of specific pieces of work though, I will try to add something about that.
4. I am very interested in exploring ways in which payments to contributors could be tied to quality of work product. I don't think that's something to mix directly with this proposal at this stage however.

2. This has been addressed in my [recent blog entry](https://blog.decred.org/2018/10/15/Politeia-in-Production/).  As monthly invoices are rolled up into a monthly payout, there is an auditing process.  If contractors are found to be billing large amounts without corresponding public deliverables, they are asked about their work, and can potentially have their invoice payment delayed.  This will become more automated over the next few months with the contractor management system.  Asking stakeholders to judge the quality of particular research strikes me as a bad idea because they don't necessarily possess the domain knowledge to judge the quality of that research, the same way most stakeholders are not in a position to judge code quality.

3. Hourly rates for Decred contractors are USD 20 / hour and up, depending on type of work, quality of work, etc.  Everyone's hourly rate will not be shared publicly, so there is some negotiation involved.

4. Bounties create a number of problems in the context of research, e.g. 2 people working on the same bounty, 1 gets the bounty, and the other has spent potentially substantial energy duplicating the other's work.  Bounties work well for things like software bugs, but even in a context  where it works well, it takes a lot of effort to manage such a bounty program.",be9f38dbf36dedf0b8233138e21091fa322148168fb78c5543234f40b4e4c55acc4f36833b622bf69f069932c325d0648dffad1f092936619cdbe5f7ec5dd40a,e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360,18,a568eb51dd086c5e14e2563b0b546454718e771cad897cc78e325487bbcff911b8ee9b7d17375d6481524e461b45cb96bb6826d0d2e4ce81a54e18d77982db0b,1539885820,2,2.0,False,fe62dd6a-2cc6-4d41-abd0-522528d33ae7,jy-p,

So why don't we skip the public vote and appoint a board of accomplished developers like other academic institutions? The conundrum here is involving the _stakeholders_ in providing consensus to the allocation of _stakeholder_ funds. After all, Decred isn't a privately funded university.

An initiative like this can grant foresight through analysis, that will help evolve the project in a way that has strong intellectual foundations. 

Why I support this:

	- Provide data that the community can leverage for collective intelligence and ultimately informed decision making
	
Some areas of research areas relevant to Decred can be:
1	How to increase antifragility and protect agaisnt consensus failures or majority attacks.
2 	Gini coefficient, and state of decentralization.
3	Privacy Research, to what extent should privacy be implemented, does it contradict or clash nation state laws.
4	DAE applicable research like, contractor rates of pay, how to pay fairly and audit in a manner that does not remove autonomy.
5	Policies to enforce in the event of misbehaving miners.

Specifically, from someone who is not close to the decred developers/contractors and their processes. I didn't know that most contractors start with a 12 hour week billing cap, for example. Thank you for that information, that's helpful and an example of what I wanted to learn from my inquiry. From looking at another comment, I also glean the following information - ""Hourly rates for Decred contractors are USD 20 / hour and up, depending on type of work, quality of work, etc. Everyone's hourly rate will not be shared publicly, so there is some negotiation involved."" If there is some kind of standard decred contractor process that will be followed, I'm not aware of any public documentation that outlines those details. If a standard decred contractor process is to be followed, that should be noted and documentation should be linked in proposal.

My questions still stand, that I would like to see a more detailed breakout of how the funds are budgeted (even if just napkin math with assumptions) before approving the proposal when it goes to voting. I don't have a lot of confidence in ""$10,000 should last a few months"" just at face value.

An example of what I'm looking for would be (given the new information provided since the original proposal):

**Budget**

_Assuming 4 new contractors would be brought on for this project with the introductory billing cap and billrate, the project has funding for ten weeks._

**_4 new contractors x 12 hours/week billing cap x 20 USD/hour x 10 weeks = $9,600]_**

This also provides transparency and accountability in the case billing were to vastly differ from a proposal budget. What assumptions were missed and by how much?

Great power hides behind this proposal. Sophisticated intelligence can help us make much better decisions. Someone knowledgeable could share the numbers, but I bet nation states spend a ton of money on intelligence.

After reading the prop for the first times I felt it is too abstract and that I don't fully understand what work will be done, so I see why people might be confused. Adding more examples of work would benefit this proposal. So I started writing down ideas for a few days.

## Existing work

First I realized that some in the spirit of this proposal _already happens_:

* [Politeia Digest](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9qnye8/politeia_digest_issue_1_a_short_weekly_update_on/)
* [Decred Journal](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/)
* [@zubairzia's articles](https://medium.com/@zubairzia)
* [@permabullnino's articles](https://medium.com/@permabullnino)
* the [list of exchanges](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Iy2-3oqk-RUT7Fz0CaBcNI289o4YyAXBew86uNCCxQ/) supporting Decred, maintained by snr01 (has many exchanges not listed by coinmarketcap!)
* the new [media tracker](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/decred-media-tracker) repository
* please share any others you know

As zubairzia0 noted, this could be so much more. Wait for it...

## Decred Intelligence Group (DIG)

First I called it Decred Intelligence Agency (DIA), but DIG sounds more fun, right?

Below are some research ideas:

* Expand the [media tracker](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/decred-media-tracker) into more thorough ongoing monitoring project that would track articles on all languages, and possibly track videos and podcasts mentionin Decred. Then add additional datasets with subjective metrics like quality.
* Ask @permabullnino (Twitter [@ImacallyouJawdy](https://twitter.com/ImacallyouJawdy)) if he has any studies planned.
* Collect and organize info about services that support Decred. Services like exchanges, wallets, payment processors and such. Dig their backgrounds, try to see which are trustworthy and reliable. This also includes actually testing them. People do it already in #marketing before announcing integrations, but I see opportunities for this process to become more organized, involve more people and produce more knowledge. snr01 has a nice spreadsheet already, and I have some drafts on this.
* Track how ratings agencies rank Decred and maybe try to educate them.
* Write tools to automatically detect new first time contributors (I need this for the Journal)
* The definitive index of community discussions. Something similar to Community Discussions section in the Journal, but as a separate project with more frequent updates and wider coverage.
* An archive of event reports.

Then there are opportunities for more deep research that might have strategic value:

* Study the pain points of running Decred full nodes to get more people to run them.
* Track which projects build on Decred or btcsuite codebase. This can be useful for marketing, recruiting and harvesting upgrades for the codebase.
* Find and connect with communities that might be interested in Decred's mission, e.g. local open source hacker communities. This effort can collaborate with marketing people and benefit marketing and recruiting.
* Watch projects active in the governance space and learn from their experience. Maintain a list/analysis of projects, tech and ideas relevant to the governance sub-domain. Compare them to Decred, see if Decred could incorporate anything good.
* Analyze narrative in social media for a given subject. Example: this year there was a lot of criticism of on-chain governance and coin voting from prominent Ethereum contributors. As we figured, their criticism applies quite well to Ethereum but not so well to ""money only"" project like Decred.
* Monitor and analyze criticism, trolling and info attacks on social media. There were several cases when a few previously unknown Reddit accounts showed up and furiously attacked some aspects of Decred, representing themselves as parts of larger offended group (e.g. poorly handled contractors) and painting things in too dramatic ways. This is potentially damanging to Decred project and ideally should be detected and revealed to the community as quickly as possible. This could involve timing and linguistic analysis of messages. I did a few of such analyses for r/decred manually and I can say it consumes a lot of time.
* Analyze general social media sentiment towards Decred. This could involve going as far as automation with sophisticated crawlers and machine learning. Could be a collaboration with teams that already work in this domain, e.g. [BittsAnalytics](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/7vqaty/nice_sentiment_uptick_on_decred_based_on_our/).

Finally, there are some interesting topics I would like to see researched but they require expertise in fields like programming or legal knowledge, while some can be only done by the developers. Still, let's not them for completeness:

* Some areas of research that zubairzia0 noted.
* Collect interesting stats from the blockchain (see a few examples in the Network stats [here](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues/2), but this will move soon).
* Stats from social media.
* What legal and tax status does Decred staking have in different countries?
* Watch the space of open hardware, look out for any devices to more securely run Decred. Perhaps even fund some (many have very nobel goals but suffer to get funded).
* Watch the topic of ASIC resistance and analyze interesting events.
* Watch the development of Lightning Network and produce short updates specifically targeted at Decred stakeholders.
* Why we should feel safe using Go, which is influenced by Google.

Regarding concerns about money waste: continued payouts are a good incentive to impress stakeholders with good intel so that they keep funding this project.",fd69a58cd1b1944147662a48a13727325e9558258bdb7c7b7eeb1cd65b6376f383455b4507462971ed9f8a14b0a013e6f0ff94a8b161eabd934b958550b96c08,a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441,32,e47e2728e481f4f98230b95e6322eac5a5e9ddbccfe50beffa1a85b0236397d559d531467414825989af9bfe6c0550e14c2eb76efe910c7db744d5dcf882510e,1540681713,5,5.0,False,b4c6eeb6-68f6-4967-a04b-33c0a22c46b3,bee,

I agree that work in the spirit of this proposal already happens (and count some of my own among it, like my analyses of the [Dash treasury](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/dash-analysis/tree/master)). 

It is not my intention that _all_ research work for Decred should have to go through this proposal. Anyone is free to take on some work they see value in and submit it for review in the usual way.

One of my aims with this proposal is about developing methods for the community to signal which research projects they see value in - so that people who do not have confidence in their read of what the community values can sidestep that issue and work on research projects that the community has signaled support for. Or, add their own ideas into the mix and see if the community sees value in them.

I like some of your ideas, and I like some of @zubairzia's ideas, but there are others I am lukewarm about. I don't see it as my place to decide whether each of those ideas are worthwhile or not. I think it would be sub-optimal to maintain a huge list of every research idea that a community member shares and say that we'll pay for work on any of those. Some have more value than others, and we should be encouraging people to work on the more useful projects, once we figure out what they are.

The other main aim of this proposal as I see it is to develop a more collaborative environment for conducting research, along with embedding standard practices of sharing data and analysis methods/code, so that the research is more replicable.",3a5a75e1db40d5569b89a22dc5aa0f219b5f227abd0a08b90903a60fc3d22cb93b083272af6bae2bc044dea74a43473ed59a71f7b3a005673f40e3cae3edac04,cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e,33,0148bd5fb102f53e49ea90e96d2e17a619c6c6bd522f798c13c20f1b0dc42019ad496463f48cf2dc3c537a267b747d0433dec969da70d7636347d3a9b5dad00e,1540686290,2,2.0,False,350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c,richard-red,

Glad this proposal does not include the any ruling around terms for ""participants in staking"" or ""staking"".

Most certainly this will be somewhat on-going work for a period of time, as it will be difficult to get all the stakepool owners to update in a coordinated manner (simply too many people) as well I imagine some odd instances may turn up with time.

> The primary rationale for moving away from the term stake pool is that it is often erroneously, and understandably, conflated with PoW mining pools in terms of the way mining pools engage in reward sharing where the pool has custody of the user's funds until they disburse them.

> In stark contrast, stake pools, or Voting Service Providers, under the proposed vernacular, never take custody of the user's funds and do not offer reward sharing.

> Another term that was discussed on this front and considered was voting server, however, I personally don't think that would be a good term as voting sever implies there is only a single server, which is not the case.
